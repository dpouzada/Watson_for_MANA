Greenpeace has requested this body a strong response against the company.Also coinciding with this scandal, just two days after the denunciation of Greenpeace, on June 27, the RSPO suspended the membership of the Nestlé company . Nestle had not reported its progress in the purchase of \"sustainable\" <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (supposedly sustainable would have to be said). In recent years, Greenpeace has denounced at least 5 cases of RSPO members who have destroyed the rainforest, including companies that are part of the RSPO's governing board and its conflict resolution panel . And the RSPO has not taken any action against them. And now suspend Nestlé for not buying enough RSPO <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. This shows that the RSPO is more concerned with raising money than protecting forests.Neither the RSPO nor the big producers like Wilmar are taking clear and determined steps to make their promises credible.

This makes Wilmar responsible for what happens in the Gama concessions.Greenpeace is asking the RSPO to enforce its rules and require Wilmar and Gama to register as a single group and suspend Wilmar until they restore the area of ​​destroyed rainforest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       -0.53843|\n",

More than three-quarters of Tesso Nilo national park, home to tigers, orangutans and elephants, has been converted into illegal palm oil plantations.

Around 24 million hectares of rainforest was destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures released by the Indonesian government [1].Deforestation and peatland destruction are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. This has pushed Indonesia into the top tier of global emitters, alongside the United States of America and China.Plantation development is a root cause of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fires. In July 2015, devastating blazes spread in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These fires produced a haze that affected millions of people across Southeast Asia. Researchers at Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that the smoke from 2015 Indonesian fires may have caused 100,000 premature deaths. The World Bank calculated the cost of the disaster at USdollars16bn.Wilmar International and other palm oil companies are regularly accused of exploiting workers, children and local communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       -1.27830|\n",

Colgate-Palmolive, Conagra Brands, Dunkin’ Brands, Grupo Bimbo, The Hershey Company, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, Krispy Kreme, Mars, Mondel_z, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever are among the brands may still be sourcing from REPSA or from suppliers that continue to do business with REPSA or the company’s parent conglomerate, Grupo Hame/Grupo Olmeca.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       -1.46881|\n",

Mr. Salim heads Indonesia’s largest conglomerate, The Salim Group. A broad network of companies, The Salim Group most notably includes Indofood, the joint venture partner of major snack food companies PepsiCo and Nestle, and First Pacific, the joint owner of Goodman Fielder.<mark>The Salim Group was first made aware of the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">ongoing deforestation</mark> in February 2016, but failed to intervene despite repeated government instructions to halt peat forest development</mark>. Instead, as the report shows, one of the subsidiary companies had the Indonesian government’s peatland moratorium map changed, even as the maps prepared by the Indonesian Peat Restoration Agency (BRG) marked most of the land bank as “peatlands prioritized for protection”.“This report provides clear evidence of shady business dealings and inaction at the highest levels of business, all while tropical rainforests continue to fall for Conflict Palm Oil,” said Gemma Tillack, Forest Policy Director with Rainforest Action Network (RAN).<mark><mark> “Meanwhile, The <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Salim Group’s financiers</mark> and business partners––like PepsiCo––are complicit in the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">illegal deforestation</mark></mark></mark>, as they continue to do business with Salim without issue</mark></mark>.<mark> PepsiCo, Nestle and Wilmar must bring their business partner into compliance with Indonesian law and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">sustainability norms of deforestation-free development</mark> or exit their business relationships</mark>.<mark><mark>”  The <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">Salim Group companies</mark></mark> are marred by <mark style=\"background-color: red\">ongoing conflict</mark></mark></mark>.<mark> Major banks, including Citibank and Rabobank, are connected to the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">illegal deforestation</mark></mark></mark> through their financing of the Salim Group, despite having policies against it</mark>. Japanese and Indonesian banks, including Mizuho and Bank Central Asia, stand out as the top lenders most exposed due to their lack of policies prohibiting such destructive activities.<mark><mark>“Billions of dollars in corporate loans, and finance from bonds and shares, have all flowed to the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">Salim Group companies</mark></mark> despite Mr Salim’s connection to ongoing <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">illegal deforestation</mark></mark></mark>,” said Vemund Olsen from Rainforest Foundation Norway</mark></mark>. “This report exposes the failure of large banks––including those that have been repeatedly warned about the Group’s environmental, social and governance risks––to address their role in facilitating carbon-intensive peat destruction. Banks need to step up their commitments to climate change and stop bankrolling peat destruction.”The report shows how the business dealings of Mr. Salim have come into question. The business empire is split into publicly listed companies controlled by The Salim Group that have declared, although failed to uphold, commitments to transparency and sustainability, and Salim-related shadow companies––or “business-on-the-side” companies as they are known in Indonesia––that continue to clear tropical forests and drain protected peatlands.“This isn’t the first time that companies in the Salim Group have been exposed for destructive practices,” said Kiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace’s Indonesian forests campaign. “The Salim Group is one of the worst offenders and has gone out of its way to keep its destructive operations separate from the public face of the Indofood empire. That’s why companies need to take responsibility for ensuring that they only use palm oil from responsible producers that protect rainforests and respect human rights.”Peat forests are particularly protected by Indonesian legal regulation because of its high fire risk––it is almost impossible to put out once on fire––and its importance in global climate regulation. Peatlands are critical carbon sinks, safely storing greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Each hectare of tropical peat drained for plantation development emits an average of 55 metric tons of CO2 every year, roughly equivalent to burning more than 6,000 gallons of gasoline. The 10,000 ha of peatland clearance is equivalent to 550,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions every year. For comparison, the average passenger vehicle emits about 5 metric tons of CO2 each year.“Consumers around the world are demanding deforestation-free products, and are calling for urgent action from banks and brands,” said Fatah Sadaoui with SumOfUs. “We can not stand by and watch the continued deforestation and growing climate chaos caused by banks’ investments or brands demand for Conflict Palm Oil.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       -1.21300|\n",

She won’t want her name to be mired in a huge public campaign and media storm about palm oil scandals, while her critics and business leaders are writing up articles about her legacy.<mark><mark><mark>Sign the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark></mark></mark> telling Pepsi’s departing CEO’s Indra Nooyi to cut ties with <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil vilain IndoFood</mark></mark> and fix <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">Pepsi’s palm oil policy</mark></mark> for good</mark></mark></mark>.Palm oil destruction is wreaking havoc in Southeast Asia. The Indonesian island of Borneo loses an area of forest the size of a football pitch EVERY 47 seconds. And as forests are cleared for palm oil, endangered species like orangutans and pygmy elephants lose their habitat and die.In the last 16 years, half of Borneo’s orangutan population was wiped out.SumOfUs members have shamed palm-oil guzzling brands into action before.

This impunity could end soon! The <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> industry’s main certification body, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) could finally kick the rogue company off its certification scheme when it meets next week, so we need to act fast.This decision will be a crucial step in getting Nestlé and Pepsi to finally cut deforestation and abuse out of their supply chains.<mark> Together, we can expose the RSPO’s greenwashing and put its reputation at risk so it doesn’t stick to business as usual and overlook <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Indofood’s gross violations</mark></mark>.<mark><mark> Sign the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark></mark> to demand the RSPO suspends <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Nestlé’s business partner</mark> Indofood</mark></mark>.<mark>Owned by <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Indonesia’s richest man</mark>, Indofood has been exposed in multiple investigations for exploiting workers, paying poverty wages (and female workers even less), dangerous working conditions, and intimidating communities off their land for illegal deforestation</mark>.<mark> It also ignores the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">RSPO’s guidelines</mark> on protecting precious orangutan habitat and is guilty of logging on carbon-rich peat land, intensifying climate chaos</mark>. Nestlé and Pepsi are in on this game. The snack food giants co-brand products in the South Asian market, and profit from lucrative Joint Venture Partnerships with Indofood -- cheating on their <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> commitments. Getting the industry’s main certification scheme to suspend Indofood could force Nestlé and Pepsi to take strong action against Indofood, or risk public backlash. A suspension would give us even more evidence to call for Nestlé and Pepsi to permanently cut ties with Indofood.<mark><mark> There’s very little time before Nestlé’s and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Pepsi's business partner</mark> gets its verdict, so please sign the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark></mark> now</mark></mark>.Together, we’ve forced some of the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> industry’s biggest players to change their destructive ways before.<mark><mark> Last year a <mark style=\"background-color: red\">huge SumOfUs <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark></mark></mark> shone light on another one of Nestlé’s dodgy <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> partners -- REPSA in Guatemala</mark></mark>. The exposure and media fall-out forced Nestlé to cut ties with the Guatemalan <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> offender! The RSPO often fails to enforce its own standards, but if we pile on the pressure it could be forced to sanction Indofood. Recently, the RSPO froze Nestlé’s membership for several weeks when it failed to comply with its rules. The suspension was a blow to Nestlé’s public image, and zoos and retailers around the world refused to stock its products for the period. That’s why we want to send a strong message to the industry by getting Indofood suspended for good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       -1.03229|\n",

If suppliers are found to be clearing forest, they’ll be immediately dropped from Wilmar’s supply chain, the company pledged in a statement released this week.FOOD & AGRICULTUREWilmar aims for <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark>-free supply chain</mark> by 2020 after protests Read nowThe firm has also said it would engage with suppliers found to be clearing forests to avoid creating a “leakage market” of farmers who continue to deforest after suspension.Wilmar supplies <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark>—the world’s most widely consumed edible oil—to all of the big consumer goods companies that promised to be <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark>-free by 2020 in a landmark commitment made almost a decade ago.It was the first <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> company to commit to stop clearing forests in 2013, and bolstered its sustainability policy two years ago.<mark> But the company has been continually linked to <mark style=\"background-color: red\">illegal forest clearing</mark> through its suppliers</mark>.<mark><mark><mark>Last month, non-government organisation (NGO) Greenpeace scaled Wilmar’s refineries in Indonesia in protest against the company’s ties to <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark> and slammed a commitment Wilmar made in October to have a <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark>-free supply chain</mark> by 2020, saying the pledge did not go far enough to ensure its suppliers would comply</mark></mark></mark>.<mark><mark> But Greenpeace said Wilmar’s new commitment is a “potential breakthrough” for the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> industry</mark>, as the use of satellites will make it impossible for Wilmar or its suppliers to get away with forest clearing undetected</mark></mark>.The NGO said it would monitor Wilmar’s progress, and suspend its publicity campaign against the company to give it space to implement the plan.<mark><mark><mark> Greenpeace said that Wilmar’s commitment puts pressure on the rest of the sector, including other <mark style=\"background-color: red\">big <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> companies</mark> such as Golden Agri Resources and Musim Mas, which it says continue to source oil from suppliers linked to <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.The news emerges a week after Norway became the first country to introduce a ban on <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark>.We encourage Norway to avoid being blinded by emotion and instead to conduct objective analyses, so that their good intention to fix this problem does not get displaced, and in turn, cause bigger problems elsewhere.Darrel Webber, chief executive, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm OilThe move, designed to sever the country’s links to tropical <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark>, will mean the Northern European country will no longer source <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> for use in biofuels by 2020.The move was praised by some environmentalists who hope other countries will follow suit to apply more pressure on the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> trade to shift to sustainable practices.“The Norwegian parliament’s decision sets an important example to other countries and underlines the need for a serious reform of the world’s <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> industry</mark>,” said Nils Hermann Ranum of green group Rainforest Foundation Norway. The <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> industry</mark>’s largest sustainable certification body has responded by arguing that Norway’s ban could cause unintended consequences, pushing <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark> elsewhere. Darrel Webber, chief executive of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), told Eco-Business: “We believe that moves such as this stem from good intentions. However, we encourage Norway to avoid being blinded by emotion and instead to conduct objective analyses, so that their good intention to fix this problem does not get displaced, and in turn, cause bigger problems elsewhere.”Webber added that RSPO is working with members to halt <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark> and improve practices, and a “concerted global effort” was needed to root <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark> out of the industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       -0.66003|\n",

Set up by Sitorus and his brother Ganda in 2011, Gama is managed by senior Wilmar executives and members of Sitorus’ family, including Hendri Saksti, according to Greenpeace International’s press release on 25 June.The allegations come almost five years after the agribusiness giant committed its entire operations worldwide, including subsidiaries and third-party suppliers, to an ambitious ‘no <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark>, no peat, no exploitation’ (NDPE) policy, responding to increasing pressure from environmental organisations such as Greenpeace International and The Forest Trust.An effort to clean up its supply chain, the NDPE policy was just one among several industry-first sustainability-linked initiatives Wilmar launched in recent years, many of which were much welcomed by environmental groups.In 2015, the company was the first in the sector to disclose the names and locations of its suppliers in its palm oil supply chain in Malaysia and Indonesia in an attempt to raise transparency levels and tackle <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark>.Last year, Wilmar announced a new policy to protect and provide education to children on its oil palm plantations. Only weeks later, it launched a sustainable finance deal with multinational banking and financial services corporation ING, being the first company in Asia to tie its financial obligations to sustainability-linked performance targets.<mark>In its press release, Greenpeace claims that Wilmar had sold off its most controversial plantations to Gama in recent years in order to evade responsibility for environmental degradation and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights violations</mark></mark>.<mark> Furthermore, analysis of trade data revealed that Wilmar continued to trade palm oil from Gama despite the knowledge that the supplier had been violating <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Wilmar’s NDPE policy</mark>, Greenpeace said in its press release</mark>.<mark>“Our investigation has exposed <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Wilmar’s dirty secret</mark>,” said Kiki Taufik, the global head of Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s Indonesian forests campaign</mark>.<mark> “For years, Wilmar and Gama have worked together, with Gama doing the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">dirty work</mark> so Wilmar’s hands stay clean</mark>.”“[The resignations] show that Wilmar is determined to blame someone else for its failings. This is not just about Gama or Martua Sitorus; it’s about Wilmar’s refusal to do what it takes to keep forest destroyers out of its supply chain,” Taufik said in the release, calling on Wilmar to demand its palm oil suppliers to publish concession maps in order to ensure their supply chain is clean and transparent.Responding to queries by Eco-Business, a Wilmar spokesperson said: “We reaffirm our commitment to our NDPE Policy which was the first to be launched in 2013. Every case of non-compliance is reviewed and monitored closely.” “Wilmar has, as of 20 June 2018, ceased sourcing from all suppliers allegedly associated with Gama as identified by Greenpeace, until they can prove to our satisfaction that they do not belong to Gama,” according to the spokesperson.<mark>They also emphasised that three plantation companies that Greenpeace reported were linked to <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark> – PT Graha Agro Nusantara, PT Agrinusa Persada Mulia and PT Agriprima Cipta Persada – are not part of Wilmar’s supply chain</mark>.Addressing the resignations, the spokesperson explained that Martua Sitorus and Hendri Saksti had already intended to step down in 2017, but were asked to retain their positions to ensure a smooth transition, adding: “In order to put to rest allegations of conflict of interest between Wilmar and Gama, Mr Sitorus and Mr Saksti have decided to bring forward their resignations [earlier].”Following the resignations, Kuok Khoon Hong, Chairman and CEO of Wilmar, had personally written to Greenpeace on 4 July, addressing concerns over the company’s sustainable supply chain efforts and detailing its next course of action in strengthening the implementation of its NDPE Policy, shared the spokesperson.“These [actions] include releasing publicly concession maps of suppliers that are in our grievance process, work with our stakeholders towards the protection and rehabilitation of remaining forests in concession areas and to have a more robust framework for verifying NDPE compliance at refinery level by the end of 2018,” they said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |       -0.06756|\n",

The palm oil supply chain is notoriously complex and lacking in transparency, but Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner Annisa Rahmawati believes the company should be making better progress on its commitments.“Wilmar promised that by the end of 2015 it would be able to show its palm oil suppliers were not destroying forests, developing on peatlands and were respecting human rights of communities and workers. This was the cornerstone of its policy, but now the company talks only of ‘aspirations’. That is simply not good enough,” says Rahmawati.Continued external pressureWilmar’s 2013 commitment was a bold move but it didn’t happen without considerable pressure from what environment author and journalist Fred Pearce describes as “strenuous NGO campaigns” and an announcement by Unilever – one of Wilmar’s customers and the world’s largest purchaser of palm oil in 2012 – that it would be tracking its entire supply chain to ensure it met its promise to end its role in <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.It’s this same pressure that environmental non-profit CDP believes will help companies realise their no <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> pledges. In its latest report CDP points out that suppliers and buyers of key agricultural forest-risk commodities, including palm oil and soy, are coming under growing pressure to ensure their supply chains do not destroy forests. “That pressure is building from their consumers and their investors,” says CDP. In 2015, 298 investors with dollars19tn (£13.3tn) in assets under management requested that companies report data about forest risks through CDP, a 24% jump from the previous year.<mark><mark>Hurowitz adds that Wilmar and other companies need to be absolutely clear to their suppliers that if they engage in <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> or <mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights abuses</mark>, they will lose access to global markets</mark></mark>. “There’s been altogether too much ambiguity about consequences, which has only encouraged some rogue actors to think they can deforest first and apologise later,” he says.<mark>So what will help end the ongoing land grab claims and forest fires that engulfed south-east Asia towards the end of last year? Hurowitz believes that governments must step up and take <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> seriously, although this doesn’t give companies carte blanche to carry on business as usual</mark>.“For the sake of their own commercial interests, the leading companies need to do more to make clear to governments that effective law enforcement is essential if the palm oil industry is to restore its damaged reputation. To accelerate progress and prevent another haze crisis, companies should join with civil society to support government efforts to hold anyone who destroys forests and peatlands legally accountable.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |        0.31130|\n",

PepsiCo has committed to purge its palm oil supply chain of <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark>, peatlands conversion and rights abuses, but the commitment does not apply to joint venture partners.    One of PepsiCo’s joint venture partners is Indofood, Indonesia’s largest food company and one of the biggest plantation companies.    NGOs like Rainforest Action Network are campaigning for the “loophole” to be plugged up.<mark>Green groups are pressuring PepsiCo to stop letting joint venture partners such as Indonesia’s biggest food company use its brand for products made with so-called <mark style=\"background-color: red\">conflict palm oil</mark></mark>.The Rainforest Action Network says the inadequate scope of PepsiCo’s new pledge to eliminate <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark>, peatlands conversion and rights abuses from its palm oil supply chain constitutes a “loophole the size of Indonesia.” The Southeast Asian country is the world’s largest palm oil producer.Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, executive director of SumOfUs.org, an international consumer watchdog organization which has gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures against PepsiCo’s palm oil commitment, said the policy “falls far short.<mark>”“This isn’t the first time that PepsiCo customers have forced the food giant to amend its palm oil policy,” Stinebrickner-Kauffman said in a statement, “but each time, PepsiCo fails to address the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">fundamental problems of rainforest destruction</mark> and the fact that workers across Southeast Asia, including children, are trapped in modern slavery in the production of palm oil</mark>.” The latest version of PepsiCo’s policy makes no mention of joint venture partners. It only mentions “direct suppliers” of palm oil and says the commitment applies to them.According to RAN, PepsiCo asserted in discussions with the NGO that “it was not willing to state that its JVPs are required to comply with its policy,” Gemma Tillack, RAN’s head agribusiness campaigner, wrote in an email.“It is vital that PepsiCo’s palm oil commitment applies to all suppliers providing palm oil that is used to make PepsiCo branded products sold globally, not just the products made in PepsiCo’s own facilities,” Tillack said.Asked if the policy applies to Indofood, PepsiCo spokeswoman Aurora Gonzalez acknowledged via email “limitations, including legal ones,” around joint ventures, and added that PepsiCo has “engaged” Indofood and is “discussing the need to take further action.<mark><mark>”Asked subsequently whether that means PepsiCo is not legally able to require Indofood to use <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark

realistic solutions and the ability to execute against an action plan,” she said in her only email.Indofood’s PT PP London Sumatra Tbk is one of Indonesia’s biggest oil palm plantation developers.<mark> The parent company is owned by the Salim Group and is one of the palm oil industry’s largest companies yet to promise to refrain from <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark

disasters in Sumatra and Borneo</mark>.Franky Welirang, a senior representative of the Indofood team, did not respond to a request for comment.As part of the campaign, RAN and Rainforest Foundation Norway commissioned a sustainability assessment of Indofood’s palm oil operations.<mark> The report was conducted by Aidenvironment and chronicles numerous land conflicts with Indonesian communities and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">acts of environmental destruction</mark> the company has been involved in</mark>.“Our documentation in the sustainability assessment report documents that Indofood have been involved in serious environmental damage, so their practice should qualify for divestment” from Norway’s global pension fund, said Nils Hermann Ranum, head of policy and campaigns at Rainforest Foundation Norway.“Indofood should read the writing on the wall,” he added.

The following material looks at a couple of cases where Wilmar has failed to resolve its conflicts with communities.<mark><mark>In 2007, FPP assisted two communities in West Kalimantan to make <mark style=\"background-color: red\">formal complaints</mark> to the RSPO and to the International Finance Corporation about <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Wilmar's operations</mark> affecting their customary lands</mark></mark>. Wilmar had been a member of the RSPO since 2005 and had received financial support from the IFC, the private finance arm of the World Bank, since 2004. The RSPO upheld the complaint that Wilmar had taken over lands of the communities of Senuju and Sajingan Kecil without their consent, and the IFC confirmed this decision and provided mediation support to resolve the dispute. In 2008, the communities reached agreement with Wilmar over the impacts of its operations, and the World Bank suspended further investments in the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> sector pending a review and policy development to avoid its financing causing negative social and environmental impacts. FPP welcomed the agreement between Wilmar and the West Kalimantan communities, but in 2014 FPP found that Wilmar had not honoured its commitments and the communities were left with unpayable debts.In 2006, FPP documented the problems that Wilmar subsidiary, PT PHP1 had caused for the Kapa community of Pasaman Barat in West Sumatra. Ten years, later the problems for the Kapa community caused by Wilmar have intensified, with the company obtaining a plantation license (HGU) without their consent, while the leaders of the community that have complained to the RSPO and government authorities have been criminalized.In January 2016, FPP staff and NGO partners visited the Kapa community and met first hand with community leaders to learn about their ongoing struggle to have their land rights recognised and respected by Wilmar.  Following the visit, FPP put out the Maninjau resolution, highlighting Wilmar's failure to respect the rights of the Kapa community and resolve conflicts with communities in good faith. The resolution called for, \"real sustainable development - development with justice - and for an end to colonial models of land development, which require native peoples’ to surrender their land to foreign investors.\"FPP will continue to highlight Wilmar's <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights abuses</mark></mark>, and in particular, its failure to respect the land rights of customary communities, until we see changes on the ground.  A 2015 regulation from the Ministry of Agraria, creates a category for Communal land rights, making it possible for communities to have their land rights recognised and registered by the government and then allowing them to lease areas to oil palm companies. While the regulation lacks implementing instructions, it may offer a way out of the current dilemma for companies that wish to respect community rights to land but can only obtain government licenses over lands to which all residual rights in land have been removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       -0.90266|\n",

The company has even failed to protect forests they are legally required to conserve.” \"No concrete plans on where forests will be restored or conserved, and with what financing\"Progress is lacking on action to reduce the climate impacts of APP’s vast concessions on peat. The Rainforest Alliance audit confirmed that other than stopping new canal development APP has taken no action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the draining of over a million hectares of peatland under company control.   WWF is also very concerned with the lack of progress by the company to resolve hundreds of social conflicts. The findings of local NGOs were confirmed in the Rainforest Alliance audit and should send high alerts through APP headquarters. WWF had welcomed APP’s 2014 announcement to restore and conserve 1 million hectares of tropical ecosystems beyond legal requirements as the right measure to address the company legacy of <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark> of an estimated 2 million hectares of tropical forest. “WWF has participated in numerous stakeholder meetings and task force activities since the announcement,” said Bayunanda. “These discussions have resulted in very little progress. There are no concrete plans on where forests will be restored or conserved, and with what financing.<mark> Even in <mark style=\"background-color: red\">APP’s priority landscape</mark>, Bukit Tigapuluh, the company has yet to take promised steps to provide wildlife corridors and stop illegal loggers, poachers and encroachers from accessing the forest through its logging road</mark>.”WWF commends APP for having invited Rainforest Alliance to audit its progress, and urges APP to act quickly and decisively to address the audit findings. WWF will also carefully study the audit findings and advise APP customers accordingly.“After two years of assessments and planning, APP needs to shift its focus to action. Today, APP promised change and WWF will monitor its next steps to see how serious it is about saving forests,” said Rod Taylor, Director, Forest Programme at WWF International.<mark> “APP customers should be alert to the risk of doing business with a company that has not yet eliminated <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark> and peat carbon emissions from its wood supply areas</mark>.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |       -0.54920|\n",

This palm oil giant concentrates 40 % of world trade in this raw material, and so these changes would have a major impact on the rest of the palm oil industry. \" Wilmar supplies palm oil to most multinational food and cosmetic companies. His plan could be a real breakthrough. If Wilmar is there, by the end of 2019, he will use satellites to monitor all his palm oil suppliers, who will no longer be able to hide the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark> they are responsible for.<mark> Greenpeace will ensure that Wilmar scrupulously respects its commitment and will continue to inform consumers about the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">environmental impact of the products of their supermarkets</mark>, \" explains Cécile Leuba, Greenpeace campaigner for Greenpeace France</mark>.The announcement by Wilmar follows an international campaign by Greenpeace to end the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark> of palm oil used by the food and cosmetics multinationals.

Over the past three months, Greenpeace activists have occupied a Wilmar refinery in Indonesia and twice docked a cargo ship carrying palm oil from Wilmar. Greenpeace Italy has blocked a plant in one of Wilmar's main customers, Mondelez, the maker of Oreo biscuits.<mark><mark> Activists also targeted the various Mondelez seats around the world to denounce the \" taste <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark> of Oreo cookies, as did local Greenpeace groups in the supermarkets of 26 cities in France</mark></mark>. Greenpeace is now suspending its campaign to give Wilmar the chance to implement his plan. The Wilmar action plan commits the trader to mapping all of his suppliers' land by the end of 2019, including the concessions from which he does not supply.<mark> Wilmar will use high resolution satellite image monitoring to check whether or not there is <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. Wilmar's trading relationship with the producers that destroyed the forests would have to be immediately suspended. Wilmar's announcement puts the rest of the industry under pressure, including other major traders such as Golden Agri Resources and Musim Mas, who also supply themselves with forest-destroying trees. Agri-food and cosmetics multinationals such as Mondelez, Nestle and Unilever are sourcing from a large number of suppliers and therefore have a responsibility to push the palm oil industry to implement similar commitments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |        0.28429|\n",

Wilmar is the world’s largest palm oil processor, accounting for over one-third of the global palm oil processing market and with a distribution network covering over 50 countries.Greenpeace believes that Wilmar and the household brands that buy its palm oil must recognise the true costs of irresponsible palm oil production. They need to ensure that their palm oil supply makes a genuine contribution to Indonesia’s development, rather than destroying the future for its people, its wildlife and the global climate on which we all depend.

Nowthough, Pepsi’s surely going to drop Indofood like a hot Cheeto… right?Wrong. Pepsi’s still cashing obscene profits from its partnership with Indofood, and reacted to the RSPO decision only with “We are very disappointed”.<mark>“Disappointed”, Pepsi?! Indofood isn’t a misbehaving toddler -- it’s a corporation that destroys rainforests, mistreats female staff, uses <mark style=\"background-color: red\">illegal child labour</mark>, and exposes its workers to hazardous pesticides</mark>.<mark><mark>Tell Pepsi: Stop disappointing us and cut ALL your ties with <mark style=\"background-color: red\">toxic palm oil company Indofood</mark>!<mark style=\"background-color: red\">Indofood’s abuses</mark> were always an open secret</mark></mark>.<mark> But in 2016, our partners at Rainforest Action Network exposed Indofood and filed an <mark style=\"background-color: red\">official complaint</mark> with the RSPO</mark>. Together, SumOfUs members used our collective power to drive up pressure last summer and get the RSPO to first sanction -- and now kick out entirely -- the palm oil giant.Now it’s official: Indofood’s palm oil cannot be called sustainable, even by the subpar RSPO standards. Meaning that if Pepsi’s ‘sustainable’ palm oil policy is to retain any scrap of credibility, it must end its joint venture partnership with the corporation -- NOW.<mark>Please sign the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark> and help force Pepsi to terminate its business partnership with Indofood once and for all!We know our people-powered campaigning can push big brands into action</mark>. After sustained pressure from SumOfUs members, Nestlé ended its own 13-year business partnership with Indofood. Showing that if PepsiCo really wanted to, it could too.And after 150,000 SumOfUs members put pressure on Pepsi’s departing CEO, Pepsi responded and stopped sourcing palm oil from Indofood -- but failed to cut ties completely, keeping its business partnership in Indonesia.Unless we use this moment to double down on our campaign, with the threats of reputation damage, negative media coverage, and lost customers, Pepsi may hope to weather out the storm. So we need to act fast.<mark>Let's tell <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Pepsi's CEO</mark> there’s no excuse for inaction on exploitation and rainforest destruction -- it's time to drop Indofood</mark>.

In an updated statement on its palm oil policy in Indonesia, PepsiCo said that it has decided to suspend sourcing palm oil from IndoAgri to its joint venture with Indofood, “pending further progress and visibility” around allegations of labour violations on its plantations. PepsiCo remains in business with the company under Indofood Fritolay Makamur (IFL)...Nestlé has also stated on its website that it had agreed to close its joint venture with Indofood Group in September 2018 for “commercial reasons”,including it in a list of companies that have been or are in the process of being removed from Nestlé supply chains....<mark>Robin Averbeck from the Rainforest Action Network, a US-based non-government organisation (NGO) that has actively campaigned against Indofood for years, called the decision by Nestlé a strong move, adding: “No company, bank or

The RSPO also suspended SIMP’s subsidiary PT Perusahaan Perkebunan London Sumatra Indonesia (Lonsum) for similar violations. Indofood, for its part, withdrew from the certification body in late January. Given Indofood’s presence in Indonesian and Southeast Asian markets, it is likely the company will focus on servicing leakage markets.<mark>The Salim Group runs First Pacific, which owns a majority stake in PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk (Indofood), <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Indonesia’s largest food company</mark></mark>. The company is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Singapore-listed IndoAgri, a vertically integrated <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil producer</mark>, is a subsidiary of Indofood.No Deforestation, No Peatland, No Deforestation (NDPE) policies have pressured Indofood and its subsidiaries to produce, refine, and sell palm oil that is not linked to deforestation. Even with these measures, Indofood’s subsidiaries still produced palm oil that did not meet RSPO standards. Indofood is vertically integrated and can circumvent the NDPE market, and it can use its own palm oil for its own food production. Indofood subsidiaries will likely supply leakage markets now that they are not RSPO members.<mark>IndoAgri has been the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">subject of ongoing RSPO complaints</mark> for child labor, poor labor practices, and producing palm oil linked to deforestation</mark>. With a landbank of approximately 550,000 hectares, its NDPE non-compliance reverberates throughout the Southeast Asia palm oil market. In February 2017, a Chain Reaction Research (CRR) paper showed that 42 percent of IndoAgri’s landbank is contested as a result of environmental degradation, conflicts with communities, and other issues. CRR estimated that the contested landbank and alleged labor risks could negatively impact IndoAgri’s share price by up to 20 percent.IndoAgri is subject to a variety of business, financial, and reputation risks. The share price for IndoAgri, whose market cap is currently USD 286 million, is down 36 percent in the past year. Approximately three-quarters of Southeast Asia’s palm oil refining capacity is covered by NDPE sourcing policy. Some traders and refiners may balk at buying palm oil from IndoAgri subsidiaries now that they are not RSPO members. IndoAgri’s problems could portend trouble for Indofood, whose withdrawal from the RSPO could negatively affect its equity price.Indofood and its subsidiaries have already dealt with fallout from accusations over the past few years. PepsiCo suspended both direct and indirect purchases of palm oil from IndoAgri in 2018, while Nestlé ended its joint venture with Indofood. Other buyers such as Hershey’s, Kellogg’s, General Mills, Unilever, and Mars have also severed relationships with the company, as have traders such as Musim Mas, AAK, and Cargill, among others. The Norwegian Government Pension Global Fund, the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, divested from Indofood in 2016 amid concerns about the production deforestation-linked palm oil. The company is also seeing a backlash from its lenders. The Rainforest Action Network, which began its campaign against Indofood in 2016, has called on banks to cancel all financing to Indofood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |       -0.63098|\n",

The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant said in a statement last week that it was “disengaging” with the conglomerate in what was expected to be a three-month process.Asked whether that meant it was cancelling its contracts with IOI or simply suspending them, a Unilever spokesperson told Mongabay, “The reason we’ve said disengaging rather than cancelled is that is takes a number of weeks to end these sorts of contracts – so the process isn’t instant.” The spokesperson added, “Separately but in tandem with this process, we are working with IOI and NGOs to try and transform IOI’s business make it sustainable – this is because of the transformational effect this could have on the palm oil industry.“IOI does now have the opportunity to turn this back around and demonstrate its commitment to sustainable palm oil but this needs to be done immediately and with complete transparency.”It is understood that Unilever told NGOs it was cancelling its contracts with IOI, one of its biggest suppliers of RSPO-brand “Certified Sustainable Palm Oil,” or CSPO.“Unilever is the first customer to cancel contracts with IOI,” Greenpeace forest campaigner Annisa Rahmawati said on Friday. “Other companies should follow its lead. If IOI wishes to regain its customers, it must take immediate and significant action to address its legacy by restoring and protecting the peatland forests it has destroyed. It must also address the serious social, labor and environmental issues that continue to taint its supply chain.”Also on Friday, Kellogg said it had already begun removing IOI from its supply chain in January because of troubling reports about its operations. As of March, 67% of IOI’s volume had been transitioned to other suppliers, and the remaining volume would be transitioned over the next 90 days, according to Kellogg.“We continue to drive industry transformation through our engagement with RSPO, all suppliers, and palm industry working groups,” the American multinational said.Mars, which is owned by the Mars family, said it would “not source palm oil from [IOI] while the suspension is in place.<mark><mark>”Unilever, Kellogg and Mars have each pledged to purge their supply chains of <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">rainforest destruction</mark></mark>, peatland conversion and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights abuses</mark>, though none can yet claim to have traced its palm oil supply to the plantation level, a prerequisite for achieving the ambitious goals</mark></mark>. Before the suspension took effect, IOI appealed to the RSPO to apply the suspension only to its plantations and not to its refineries, so that IOI Loders Croklaan could continue marketing CSPO and avoid disrupting its customers’ supply schemes.“I can admire the chutzpah required to put such an outlandishly attenuated notion of justice on paper – that there should be no accountability because accountability would cause some commercial disruption,” Glenn Hurowitz, former chairman of the Forest Heroes campaign, which tries to get corporations to adopt zero-deforestation policies, wrote in the Huffington Post.<mark>“But after six years of having every chance in the world to address these grievances in some other fashion, and meanwhile continuing to pile up <mark style=\"background-color: red\">serious deforestation</mark> and labor rights violations, I would hope RSPO takes IOI’s appeal as seriously as IOI has taken any one of its own promises to do better</mark>.” IOI has submitted an action plan for RSPO reentry, and a spokesperson said the company “is very concerned about the impact on its stakeholders and reputation, if the group is not able to supply certified palm oil in the future due to prolonged suspension; these potential sales losses are not quantifiable.”IOI is controlled by the family of the 77-year-old Lee Shin Cheng, whose net worth Forbes estimates at dollars5 billion.

The <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> reaches major brands via a twisting supply chain that stretches from the PT Agra Bumi Niaga (ABN) logging company, which delivers to a processing mill owned by PT Ensem Sawita (ES), which then sells the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> on to some of the world’s largest traders. PT is an abbreviation that denotes a limited liability company in Indonesia.PT ABN declined requests for comment but after extensive Guardian inquiries, PT ES admitted using ABN’s <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> – due to confusion after the logging firm changed its name – and said that it “regretted this failure”.The company promised to “strengthen our traceability practices by exchanging information to relevant stakeholders who have <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> plantation data.”However, Gemma Tillack, RAN’s agribusiness campaigns director, said that ABN’s name change had been reported, and the continued inability of palm traders and food brands to source the palm they used back to the plantations showed a wider failing of due diligence systems.“Relying on NGOs to uncover the truth is simply not good enough,” she said. “If RAN, with our relatively limited budget, can figure it out, then multibillion dollar, multinational corporations certainly can. The fact that they haven’t demonstrates that it is not a lack of ability holding them back, but a lack of will.”Leuser’s vanishing ecosystem is already have a devastating effect on critically endangered elephants which use it as a migratory corridor.<mark> At least 35 elephants were killed in Leuser between 2012-2015, and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">human-animal conflicts</mark> are fast increasing as palm plantations fragment animal habitats</mark>.Many species such as tigers, clouded leopards and sun bears are becoming more vulnerable to poachers, as their environment disappears. Leuser is still Sumatra’s largest rainforest and its Unesco world heritage status was reaffirmed this month, despite Indonesian government protests.But its deforestation rate is among the world’s highest. In the 2015 haze disaster, Sumatran wildfires, often linked to plantation activity, destroyed 8,000 sq miles of rainforest, contributing to the early deaths of an  and  that year.Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo responded with a moratorium on new <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> permits last April. Two months later, Aceh’s governor, Zaini Abdullah ordered <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> companies to halt all forest clearing, even where valid permits existed.But RAN’s research shows that ABN continued clearing another 336 hectares of Sumatran rainforest after Abdullah’s instruction, with 12 hectares of new deforestation since February.In just one district of the Leuser, nine other suppliers to milling companies continued logging activities since last June across concessions with a combined area of more than 26,000 hectares, according to RAN’s research. Tillack said: “We believe that there was a rush to clear land because the [logging] companies knew that there would be government intervention to stop forest clearances.“Global brands like Pepsico can no longer hide behind paper promises and simply blame their international partners for forest crimes. The Leuser ecosystem will die a death of a thousand cuts if brands don’t start taking urgent action to address the root cause of this crisis.”A spokesman for Pepsico, singled out by RAN as , said “We take this issue very seriously, and we are making significant investments to improve every aspect of our <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> supply chain. After being informed of the allegations, we immediately initiated a thorough investigation. While we do not source directly from the mills in question, we identified direct suppliers who had the mills in their supply chains. We have been assured that these suppliers are taking corrective actions to address the allegations.”Unilever admitted that it had indirectly bought <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> from PT ABN through its suppliers, Wilmar and Musim Mas, and said that it had requested “a response and an action plan” from them soon.Nestlé also said that it was investigating the allegations with Wilmar – which told the guardian that it was sending a team to the region to assess whether other sources in its supply chain were using <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> sourcing back to PT ABN’s 2,000 hectare concession. Mars and Kellogg’s stressed their sustainable <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> policies, while Procter & Gamble said that it had told suppliers about its responsible sourcing policy. McDonald’s denied any links to PT ABN.Of the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> traders which supplying the food brands, IOI said that that it had “registered recent deliveries from PT ES in our supply chain” but that the firm had “confirmed that they no longer source from PT ABN”. Golden Agri-Resources said that its exposure to PT ES was “relatively small” but that it would visit the company in the next weeks to find out if it was indirectly selling on <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> from PT ABN. Cargill and Musim Mas both said that they were investigating the reports.However, the companies had been warned about ‘conflict <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark>’ entering the supply chain through PT ES’s third-party suppliers since 2014, and engagement with the firm had not changed its behaviour.<mark>“Brands and traders tend to hide behind supply chain complexities,” she said, “but consumers need to know whether or not the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> they use is connected to the destruction of rainforests</mark>.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       -0.96368|\n",

Together, we pressured the world’s leading <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> certification body to respond. That's something to celebrate!Now’s our chance to get Pepsi to finally cut ties with Indofood. Pepsi still cashes in obscene profits from a joint venture partnership with the company, and Pepsi has a new CEO who hasn’t heard from SumOfUs members yet.<mark><mark><mark>Can you help make this victory count by signing the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark></mark></mark> telling Pepsi to distance itself from the toxic <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> company for good?Our allies at Rainforest Action Network first revealed <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Indofood’s abuses</mark> two years ago</mark></mark></mark>. Together, SumOfUs members used our collective power to drive up pressure this summer and achieve these sanctions.And we did it! The RSPO's report on Indofood confirmed:Female workers are paid less than men, do not receive equal job benefits as men, and are not entitled to maternity leave. Overly high quotas are enforced, that put pressure on harvesters to bring in their family, including children, or face penaltiesIndofood breaks Indonesian labour laws by over relying on casual workers, who are paid less than minimum wage and denied health insurance and pensions.The decision to finally punish Indofood is a critical step towards justice for workers who face dangerous, oppressive, and illegal working conditions. The RSPO is suspending Indofood’s “sustainability” certificates of the mill and estates where the abuses were documented and is requiring a corrective action plan.While we're still pushing for the RSPO to suspend certification for all Indofood's operations, these sanctions are clear evidence that Pepsi must end its joint venture partnership with Indofood -- if its ‘sustainable’ <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> policy is to retain any scrap of credibility.<mark> Please sign the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark></mark></mark> and help force Pepsi to terminate its business deal with Indofood once and for allWe know our people-powered campaigning can push big brands into action</mark>. Last month, after sustained pressure from SumOfUs members, Nestlé ended its own 13 year old business partnership with Indofood. Showing that if PepsiCo really wanted to, it could too. And when 150,000 SumOfUs members put pressure on Pepsi’s departing CEO last month, Pepsi responded and stopped sourcing <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> from Indofood -- but failed to cut ties completely, keeping its business partnership in Indonesia. Unless we use this moment to double down on our campaign, with the threats of reputation damage, negative media coverage, and lost customers, Pepsi may hope to weather out the storm until the sanctions end. So we need to act fast.Let's tell Pepsi's new CEO there’s simply no excuse for inaction on exploitation and rainforest destruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |       -0.78647|\n",

Now they have no excuse not to force FGV to change, but unless they feel the pressure to act, they could try to weather the storm.Both Unilever and Hershey’s have dropped FGV, and now we need your help to create a domino effect and put FGV against the wall -- to force it to change its exploitative ways.<mark><mark> Can you sign the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark> to demand that Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, Mondelez, and PepsiCo end <mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights abuse</mark> in their supply chains?Tell Procter & Gamble & big brands to stop doing business with FGV until workers’ rights are respected on palm oil plantations</mark></mark>.To produce the oil it sells to P&G, Nestle, Mondelez, and Pepsico, FGV is reliant on migrant workers recruited by mercenary human traffickers. These “contractors” withhold workers’ passports, overcharge them for food and necessities,and refuse to let them leave plantations without written permission.That oil, harvested by migrant workers forced to endure dire living conditions, goes into Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Herbal Essences shampoo, and other products we use every day.In response to the RSPO sanctions, FGV announced it would overhaul its recruitment policy -- but until it can prove its workers are being treated humanely, paid fair wages, and not subjected to modern day slavery conditions, Procter & Gamble and big brands must use their leverage and put pressure on FGV to force to change its ways for good.If not, they’re sending the message that these companies value profits over human rights. And that’s a message any public-facing corporation can’t afford to send now.Tell P&G, PepsiCo, Nestle, Mars and other brands to honour their sustainability commitments and force FGV into real action!The past couple of months have seen some huge victories by SumOfUs members against unethical and inhumane palm oil actors.<mark> Over 240,000 of you helped push the RSPO to sanction <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Pepsi’s business partner Indofood</mark> over its labour law abuses</mark>.Our pressure is transforming the palm oil industry -- and if we can keep this momentum going, there’s no telling how much more we can accomplish together.Tell P&G, PepsiCo, Nestle, Mars and other brands to honour their sustainability commitments and force FGV into real action!

APP remains the first among a very small number of the most controversial companies in the world FSC has disassociated from.WWF strongly recommends that companies and financial investors end their business relationships with SMG/APP and its affiliates, including Nippecraft Ltd., Collins Debben Ltd.-Australia, and Collins Debben Ltd.-United Kingdom, whose FSC certificates were recently suspended, until a regular, truly independent third-party verification demonstrates significant progress by SMG/APP companies, its affiliates and global wood supply partners. This progress should be measured against the NGOs’ published Criteria and Indicators which include an association with FSC among the performance criteria.

In total, it is 11 companies in the cosmetics and food sectors who have agreed to be transparent; the bad news is that we have found links with producers who destroy the forests in the lists of suppliers and factories published by these companies.<mark> These companies must immediately sort through their supply chain and break off commercial ties with producers who refuse to comply with <mark style=\"background-color: red\">zero deforestation commitments</mark></mark>. There are also bad students like Hershey's, Johnson & Johnson, Kellog's, Smucker's and Kraft Heinz, who still refuse to publish a list of their suppliers, and in doing so, hide their potential links with companies that destroy tropical forests, drain peatlands, and violate workers' rights. In order to prove that the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> they use in the products we find in our supermarkets does not come from plantations that are responsible for deforestation, they must start by doing all the light on their suppliers.<mark><mark><mark> In Indonesia, the <mark style=\"background-color: red\">destruction of tropical forests</mark> for the cultivation of <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> shows no signs of slowing down</mark></mark></mark>. Various NGOs have established a link between major brands and <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> companies that destroy tropical forests and exploit local labor. This is the case with Global Witness, RAN, Amnesty International and Chain Reaction Research. Indonesia is home to more threatened or endangered species than any other country. This sad record is largely due to the loss of habitat for these species. Borneo's orangutan population has halved since 1999, with a loss of 100,000 individuals over the past 16 years. In 2017, a new species of orangutans was discovered on the island of Sumatra. She is already in danger. According to the analyses carried out by Greenpeace based on official data, 24 million hectares of forest were destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015. In the period 2013-2015, a surface equivalent to 146 football fields was destroyed every hour. There are less than 1,000 days left for companies to fulfil their commitment and to prove to consumers and civil society that their products are guaranteed without deforestation.

False promisesKiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace’s global Indonesia forests campaign said: \"Wilmar has been promising to clean up its supply chain since 2013. Yet it is still buying <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> from forest destroyers.\"It is not Greenpeace’s responsibility to police their supply chain. Wilmar should only buy <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> from producers it can prove are clean. That is what Wilmar CEO Kuok Khoon Hong promised almost five years ago.\" The Greenpeace team includes volunteers and climbers from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the UK, France and Australia.One group of  activists climbed the anchor chain of a tanker ship transporting <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> and are preventing it from moving. Another group scaled the refinery and painted “DIRTY” in five-metre high letters on the storage tanks. Severe <mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark>In 2013, Wilmar became the first <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> trader to adopt a ‘no <mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark>, no peat, no exploitation’ policy.But last week, a Greenpeace International investigation revealed that 25 <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> producers had cleared 130,000ha of rainforest since 2015. Wilmar was buying from 18 of those <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> groups; three supplied the refinery where the protest is taking place.Only a fraction of the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> that Wilmar trades comes from its own plantations; more than 80 percent comes from other <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> producers.  Dal Payne, a climber from the UK taking part in the action said: “This refinery is loaded with Wilmar’s dirty <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> and if we weren’t here it would be on its way to supermarkets all over the world. Hundreds of thousands of consumers have had enough of forest destruction.\"The message to brands like Unilever, Nestlé and Mondelez is simple: cut Wilmar off until it breaks all links with forest destroyers.”Forest destroyersGreenpeace is calling on Wilmar to prove that it no longer sources <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> from forest destroyers. The first step is to requiring all producer groups in its supply chain to publish mill location data and concession maps for their entire operations and to cut off any that refuse.  Wilmar International and other <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> groups are regularly accused of exploiting workers, children and local communities.<mark><mark><mark> The plantation sector - <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> and pulp - is the single largest driver of <mark style=\"background-color: red\">deforestation</mark> in Indonesia</mark></mark></mark>. Around 24 million hectares of rainforest was destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures released by the Indonesian government. Deforestation and peatland destruction are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. This has pushed Indonesia into the top tier of global emitters, alongside the United States of America and China.Plantation development is a root cause of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fires. In July 2015, devastating blazes spread in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These fires produced a haze that affected millions of people across Southeast Asia.Researchers at Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that the smoke from 2015 Indonesian fires may have caused 100,000 premature deaths. The World Bank calculated the cost of the disaster at 16 billion US dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       -0.95851|\n",

Indofood also ignores the directives of the RSPO on the protection of the precious habitat of orangutans and is guilty of logging on Carbon-rich peatlands, intensifying climate chaos. Nestlé is in the process. The food giant is working with Indofood to market its products in the South Asian market by benefiting from a lucrative partnership, cheating on its palm oil commitments. The suspension of Indofood by the industry's main certification system could force Nestlé to take drastic measures against Indofood, otherwise negative reactions from the public could be provoked. A suspension would strengthen our call for Nestle and PepsiCo to permanently break their ties with Indofood.

But for communities suffering its land grabs in Nigeria, nothing has changed. While Wilmar spins green rhetoric, its bulldozers are still destroying vast swathes of forest and farmland. In December 2013 Wilmar adopted a \"no deforestation, no peat and no exploitation policy\" to address its well-documented environmental and human rights failings.It was hailed as a brave step which would take Wilmar from being named by Newsweek as the world's least environmentally friendly big company in 2012 to a champion of sustainable operations.<mark>Wilmar gave itself, its subsidiaries, and its third party suppliers two years to reach its goal: a serious-sounding commitment to dealing with the land-grabbing cases, <mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights abuses</mark>, forest destruction and climate impacts that have dogged its operations</mark>.Good news? Not quite. Friends of the Earth Europe has been campaigning for years to address the problems that Wilmar has caused in South East Asia and Africa. Our groups in Indonesia, Nigeria, Liberia and Uganda continue to see misconduct by Wilmar and its subsidiaries in these countries.In February this year legal action was taken by affected farmers in Uganda to claim restitution for their grabbed land and fair compensation for damages, three years after their land was taken for the plantation development.'Aggressive expansion' in NigeriaIn 2011 and 2012, Wilmar International purchased several plantation sites in Cross River State in southeastern Nigeria. These land purchases were part of the state's efforts to court 'high capacity' foreign investors to revive its flagging plantation economy.Together these plantations form a joint venture between Wilmar and the British food commodity firm PZ Cussons - PZ Wilmar.According to a November 2014 article in Businessday PZ Wilmar's investment of dollars165 million to develop the current 26,000 hectares of palm oil plantations is only the beginning. Tunde Oyelola, vice chairman of PZ Wilmar, announced plans to\" ... aggressively expand the nation's palm oil production to 240,000 hectares of plantations, employing over 250,000 within five to six years.\"Deforestation, land grabs, pollution, exploitationThe plantation in Nigeria began development before Wilmar's sustainability pledge in 2013, but its expansion has continued apace since. A Friends of the Earth delegation organised by Environmental Rights Action / Friends of the Earth Nigeria visited affected communities in May 2015.Our visit was sobering. Far from operating like a corporation intent on meeting sustainability goals, Wilmar is up to its old tricks. In the village of Ibogo, the local community saw their farmland being excavated just one week before we arrived. They took us to show the land and the destroyed crops.Their stories are heartbreaking, because these people are desperate. Some of them have been cultivating the land for decades, and now their crops - plantains, bananas, cocoa and vegetables - are destroyed they have no way to provide alternative livelihoods.William Ogobe, 29, and with a young family, told us that the project had taken his farmland:\"We used to plant plantains, cassava, cocoyam and vegetables here, as well as trees for timber. We grew wood for businesses, for houses and to feed ourselves - for firewood. Now because the forest is gone we have nothing left. When the project finishes, we will have no future left. Wilmar wants to render us useless in life. But we will not accept this.\"The citizens of Ibogo are right to be worried about their future. At other plantations that had already been developed, the consequences have been disastrous.In the nearby village of Betem, the water supply was severely damaged and polluted by PZ Wilmar's operations. The alternative borehole that PZ Wilmar supplied is not functioning and the company has not dropped by to repair it. Even for the brief spell where it worked, the water quality was poor, a thick brown liquid that was a major source of illness in the community.Meanwhile down the road, the leader of the village of Idoma, Chief Steven Omari complained: \"As a consequence of the Wilmar project, our forest has been seriously degraded. Our timber has been destroyed and they have yet to compensate us. People who were farming in that area lost their land and they have yet to be compensated.\"PZ Wilmar has provided jobs to some in the community, but these are volatile, contract-free positions as day labourers - a far cry from the work of operating small-scale farms of their own. With no occupational training offered, it is difficult to see a way out for many.<mark><mark>Legal challenge and community actionCases like these - of <mark style=\"background-color: red\">environmental destruction</mark>, and <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights violations</mark></mark> - formed the basis of a federal lawsuit from the Nigeria-based NGO Rainforest Resource & Development Centre in 2013</mark></mark>. After a lengthy delay, the case will hopefully be heard in June 2015.There are also calls to to charge PZ Wilmar with contempt of court, because it continues to operate, whereas legally they should have stopped their operations during the trial. But while the legal process rumbles on, communities in Nigeria are organising.ERA / Friends of the Earth Nigeria recently set up a volunteer-run community forest watch programme, which unites 13 communities affected by Wilmar's plantations, provides training to these communities and develops joint strategies to protect the forest and people's livelihoods.These responses to Wilmar's land grabbing at the local level are a powerful reminder of the potency of community action.Financiers and international community must share responsibilityNigeria is not an isolated case for Wilmar - and they are not solely accountable. The chain of responsibility stretches back to those that finance their operations. Friends of the Earth groups in Europe and the US have regularly brought the case to the attention of Wilmar International and its European and US financiers.We have also reported on how Wilmar's land grabbing in Uganda has been financed by the United Nations agency IFAD, the International Fund for Agricultural Development. In 2010 IFAD backed an oil palm project partly owned and operated by Wilmar on Bugula Island, Lake Victoria, with a dollars52 million loan. But it refused to comment when asked about the 3,600 hectares of pristine forest it had destroyed, and the hundreds of farmers left destitute after their land was grabbed.The continued inaction further proves that we cannot rely on self-regulation by either companies or financiers for genuine action.<mark> Wilmar has not changed its ways of working - it is high time to bring the company to account for its <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">human rights violations</mark></mark>, ameliorate its environmental impacts and pay compensation to the hundreds of victims facing eviction and dispossession</mark>.It is also essential that governments, financiers and UN agencies do not wait for Wilmar and others like it to improve their practices. Binding human rights and environmental rules for companies and their financiers must be established at the national and international levels.In June 2014 the UN Human Rights Council put in place the first steps towards setting binding international human rights regulations for transnational corporations like Wilmar.Friends of the Earth Europe, together with many other groups, is campaigning to ensure the UN adopts a proposal which would increase access to justice for local communities and affected people in Nigeria and around the world.|       -0.77961|\n",

Up to this date, APP has not shown independent proof to counter these concerns, but instead started production at the mill on December 23, 2016.<mark><mark><mark> In addition to the concerns about <mark style=\"background-color: red\">potential future deforestation</mark>, the NGOs highlighted <mark style=\"background-color: red\">APP’s contribution</mark> in jeopardizing <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Indonesia’s climate commitments</mark> by having more than 60 per cent of its huge land bank on peatland</mark></mark></mark>. Plantation development on peatland causes extremely high carbon emissions, especially through catastrophic fires. According to a soon-to-be released analysis by Eyes on the Forest, 43 per cent of APP's land bank are in areas that Indonesia’s government has marked for restoration, posing huge challenges for the company to comply and secure wood supplies for its pulp mills.<mark> After decades of destroying the environment and causing <mark style=\"background-color: red\">conflict</mark> with local communities, APP is urged to take these concerns seriously and start acting</mark>. A credible first step would be a time-bound commitment to create buffer zones of restored forest around remaining natural peat forest areas, and the development of alternative forestry practices on rewetted peatlands with local tree species adapted to peat swamp conditions.

IOI is alleged to have cleared rainforest in the Indonesian part of Borneo island without a permit, damaged carbon-rich deep peatlands there and used fire to clear land for planting, all of which is illegal in Indonesia.Bunge wants IOI, which has promised to stop deforesting, to adopt the accepted working definition for what a “high carbon stock” forest is, launch a public dashboard through which customers and the public can easily access critical information, and address the grievances that have been lodged against it.The U.S.-headquartered food company also asked IOI to issue an a more detailed sourcing policy with clear deliverables and timelines. While many of the biggest palm oil producers have publicly committed to eliminate deforestation, peatlands conversion and human rights abuses from their supply chains, the pledges are often vague, and no major firm can show it has actually achieved its goal. IOI is no exception. “We will continue to engage with IOI to provide input, assess progress and discuss broader issues related to sustainable sourcing and Bunge’s requirements and plans,” Bunge said in a statement.<mark>Unilever, Hershey’s, Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, SC Johnson, Yum!

Brands, Citigroup, Mizuho, Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), SMBC Group, Rabobank and Standard Chartered. They can't pretend that Indofood is sustainable.It’s time to let these companies know: we seeeee you! Call on these buyers and banks to STOP doing business with Indofood until it cleans up its act.Indofood’s track record keeps getting worse and worse. In the latest turn of events, the Roundtable on <mark style=\"background-color: red\">Sustainable Palm Oil</mark> (RSPO) terminated Indofood’s sustainability certificates and membership.<mark> Indofood is guilty of worker exploitation, <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">rainforest destruction</mark></mark> and habitat loss, and now it has no “sustainability” claims to hide behind</mark>.It is far past time that your company end all business relationships with this bad actor until it cleans up its act.Other companies — including Musim Mas, Cargill, Fuji Oil, Hershey’s, Kellogg’s, General Mills, Unilever, and Mars — have cut Indofood from their supply chains. Joint venture partners Nestlé and Wilmar have ended their relationship with Indofood, and banks like BNP Paribas stopped financing the company's palm oil operations.You must act immediately — cut all ties to Indofood and send a clear market signal that the company must change. There is no time for more delays.

Now it’s time to hold the company accountable. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the world’s largest certification system for “sustainable” palm oil, and it’s far past time for the RSPO to suspend Indofood. Take action now:  We demand that the RSPO send the clearest message to Indofood and any other company that destroys with one hand as they sell palm oil with the other: clean up your act or you’re out. Indonesian food manufacturing company and palm oil giant Indofood continues to evade its responsibilities to uphold RSPO standards and address the worker exploitation on its plantations. It is far past time that you expel this bad actor from your certification system.<mark>Indofood’s announcement that it will withdraw the RSPO membership of its subsidiary London Sumatra rather than address its <mark style=\"background-color: red\">labor abuses</mark> is a dangerous precedent that you cannot allow</mark>.You must act immediately and suspend the membership and certification for all of Indofood, including both subsidiaries London Sumatra and Salim Ivomas. Failure to expel Indofood will send a clear signal that the RSPO is incapable of managing bad actors and is therefore not a credible certification system.There is no time for more delays — suspend all of Indofood's \"sustainability\" certifications until it stops abuses of workers' rights.

Universe, and Thai seafood <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">companies</mark></mark> Phatthana Seafood Co. Ltd. and S.S. Frozen Food Co. Ltd. – filed amotion in mid-August to dismiss the case arguing that because the alleged conduct took place outside the US, the matter shouldn't be heard in a US court.Walmart, while referenced in a press release describing the matter, is not named in the lawsuit as defendant.In a ruling released Nov. 10, Judge John Walter said that the court has sufficient jurisdiction to proceed, ruling against the defendants' motion to dismiss.In a press release following the ruling, Agnieszka Fryszman, an attorney who is representing the plaintiffs pro bono, wrote in a statement to Undercurrent News that her clients \"had nothing to show for their hard labor and their families were poorer than before” when they returned home after their employment. “Fortunately, in the Trafficking Victim’s Protection Act, Congress gave trafficked workers the tools they need to obtain justice when <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">companies</mark></mark> knowingly profit from forced labor in their supply chains. We are pleased that these claims can go forward in a U.S. court and we look forward to proving our case at trial,” she said.Attorney Charles Kreindler, whose firm represents all four defendants, told Undercurrent that he was pleased with an aspect of the judge's ruling that dismiss the plaintiff's claims based on another law, the Alien Tort Statute.He added that this stage of the proceeding focused on the laws and not the facts, scrutiny of which will come later.\"While the court at this early stage of the proceeding allowed plaintiffs to move forward with certain other claims, that ruling was based on the court accepting each and every allegation made by the plaintiffs as true,\" he said. \"We are confident that we will show the court at a later date that the remaining claims are legally and factually unfounded and believe that the case will not go to trial. Of course, we will continue to vigorously defend against these false allegations.\"According to the lawsuit, the Cambodian plaintiffs were allegedly recruited from their villages and employed by the defendants outside the US, chiefly in Thailand.The suit states that the Cambodian villagers paid high recruitment fees but at the Thai factory were \"paid less than promised and that their already meager wages would be further reduced by unexpected salary deductions for housing, fees, and other charges.\"The defendants asserted that “the conduct complained of occurred outside the US and the complaint does not allege a basis for extraterritorial jurisdiction”.Lawyers representing the Cambodian villagers argue that the defendants’ basis for dismissal is incorrect.Among other arguments laid out in the the response, the plaintiffs said that the defendants' failed to take into account changes that had been made to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2008.According to the filing, in 2008 the US Congress amended the act to \"include accountability over the entire trafficking chain, including those at the top who financially benefit and those whose conduct occurs overseas\".The case, they said, relied \"almost exclusively on a case law that predates the key 2008 amendments to the [Trafficking Victims Protection Act] and repeatedly misread the current statute, ignoring the relevant provisions enacted in 2008 that underpin the plaintiff's claims\".The Cambodians' lawyers said that \"there was no extraterritorial jurisdiction provision at all [in the other case]...Congress amended the [Trafficking Victims Protection Act] in 2008 to expressly provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction over certain trafficking offenses, including the violations alleged here\".In response to the plaintiff's allegations, the defendants filed a reply on Oct. 14 agreeing that \"Congress certainly has the authority to enact criminal laws with extraterritorial reach\", but added that it \"did not intend to allow private plaintiffs to take advantage of extraterritorial jurisdiction to seek to impose global labor standards on foreign <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">companies</mark></mark>\".The defendants argued that the \"extraterritorial reach of the [Trafficking Victims Protection Act] extends only to criminal actions brought by the federal government, and not to private plaintiffs\".<mark>Among other complaints in the filing, the defendants also argue that the accusation that two US-based <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">companies</mark></mark> should be held accountable because they knowingly benefitted from alleged human trafficking is vague and can be applied to virtually any US company</mark>.\"Plaintiffs ask this court to construe the [Trafficking Victims Protection Act] to impose liability on any US company that “benefits” from doing business with foreign <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">companies</mark></mark> in parts of the world that have arguably suspect labor practices. If plaintiffs are right, then the litigation floodgates would open, since virtually every US company benefits from international commerce,\" the filing said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       -0.79461|\n",

The next year, the company agreed to a settlement with almost 600 former workers who had been exposed to toxic mercury vapour at the now-closed thermometer factory.It’s been a couple of years since then, but Kodaikanal Still Won’t. Ashraf is back with a sequel (video above), accompanied by Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna and indie rock musician Amrit Rao to belt out a catchy number that fuses Carnatic, rap and Tamil Gaana Kuthu genres. The music video aims to bring attention to a <mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark> filed by Chennai-based activists targeting Unilever’s CEO Paul Polman.<mark><mark> The <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">petition</mark> claims</mark> that Unilever’s failed trial remediation of the environment in November 2017 ended up mobilising more mercury into the environment that it recovered, because it deployed a substandard process</mark></mark>. The activists allege that the company’s proposed clean-up will leave behind 20 times more mercury in Kodaikanal’s soil than is considered safe for residential areas in the United Kingdom, and 66 times more than levels considered safe in the Netherlands.“Such a shoddy clean-up will never be permitted in Europe,” said Chennai-based social activist Nityanand Jayaraman in a press release. “Unilever’s refusal to apply the best standards for India reeks of environmental racism.”According to the press release, “environmental racism is when environmental harm is disproportionately apportioned to marginalised communities, and when the agencies or parties discriminate by deploying environmentally substandard practices when operating among such communities.”Ashraf, Krishna and the director of the video Rathindran R Prasad plan to travel to the Netherlands and UK later this year to collaborate with musicians there to bring attention to the company’s actions.

False promisesKiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace’s global Indonesia forests campaign said: \"Wilmar has been promising to clean up its supply chain since 2013. Yet it is still buying <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> from forest destroyers.\"It is not Greenpeace’s responsibility to police their supply chain. Wilmar should only buy <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> from producers it can prove are clean. That is what Wilmar CEO Kuok Khoon Hong promised almost five years ago.\" The Greenpeace team includes volunteers and climbers from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the UK, France and Australia. One group of  activists climbed the anchor chain of a tanker ship transporting <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> and are preventing it from moving. Another group scaled the refinery and painted “DIRTY” in five-metre high letters on the storage tanks. Severe deforestationIn 2013, Wilmar became the first <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> trader to adopt a ‘no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation’ policy. But last week, a Greenpeace International investigation revealed that 25 <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> producers had cleared 130,000ha of rainforest since 2015. Wilmar was buying from 18 of those <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> groups; three supplied the refinery where the protest is taking place. Only a fraction of the <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> that Wilmar trades comes from its own plantations; more than 80 percent comes from other <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> producers. Dal Payne, a climber from the UK taking part in the action said: “This refinery is loaded with Wilmar’s dirty <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> and if we weren’t here it would be on its way to supermarkets all over the world. Hundreds of thousands of consumers have had enough of forest destruction. \"The message to brands like Unilever, Nestlé and Mondelez is simple: cut Wilmar off until it breaks all links with forest destroyers.”Forest destroyersGreenpeace is calling on Wilmar to prove that it no longer sources <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> from forest destroyers. The first step is to requiring all producer groups in its supply chain to publish mill location data and concession maps for their entire operations and to cut off any that refuse. Wilmar International and other <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> groups are regularly accused of exploiting workers, children and local communities.<mark> The plantation sector - <mark style=\"background-color: red\"><mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark></mark> and pulp - is the single largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia</mark>. Around 24 million hectares of rainforest was destroyed in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015, according to official figures released by the Indonesian government. Deforestation and peatland destruction are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. This has pushed Indonesia into the top tier of global emitters, alongside the United States of America and China.Plantation development is a root cause of Indonesia’s forest and peatland fires. In July 2015, devastating blazes spread in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These fires produced a haze that affected millions of people across Southeast Asia.Researchers at Harvard and Columbia Universities estimate that the smoke from 2015 Indonesian fires may have caused 100,000 premature deaths. The World Bank calculated the cost of the disaster at 16 billion US dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       -0.73080|\n",

IOI owns Europe’s largest palm oil refinery and is such a major player that the RSPO warned of a disruption to supplies of sustainable palm oil following the suspension. “The decision to challenge the RSPO board’s suspension decision is a difficult and painful one for us to take,” said Dato’ Lee Yeow Chor, IOI’s CEO, of the suit filed in Zurich, Switzerland, where the roundtable has its seat. IOI is understood to claim it did no wrong and the RSPO had no right to suspend its sustainability certification.In a statement, Dato’ Lee said that while the company was committed to the RSPO, it had been “unfairly affected” by the suspension.<mark><mark>IOI has long been the target of environmentalists, who have previously accused it of felling forests and draining peatlands in Malaysian Borneo, while <mark style=\"background-color: red\">allegations of deforestation</mark> in IOI concessions in Ketapang, West Kalimantan, were submitted in a <mark style=\"background-color: red\">formal complaint</mark> to the RSPO by a sustainability consultancy in 2015</mark></mark>.The scale of the financial impact on IOI from lost contracts following the suspension is not yet clear. But internal communications from Datuk Darrel Webber, CEO of the RSPO, show that the palm oil producer told him: “IOI has suffered commercial and reputational losses as a result of this injustice.”Webber also reveals that “IOI prefers if this legal action is kept low profile” and that he is concerned over “the amount of time and money that will be wasted in this process [defending the legal challenge].”In the communications, Darrel Webber says that the roundtable is insured against such claims up to 10m Malaysian Ringgit (£1.72m).Richard George, head of forests at Greenpeace UK, said: “No one should be surprised that IOI has chosen to bully its critics. The RSPO and its members must meet this intimidation head on by excluding IOI until it has cleaned up its act and repaired the forests and peatlands it has destroyed.”Malaysian and Indonesian companies dominate global palm oil production, but have been linked to deforestation and slash-and-burn clearance methods that contributed to the .

While IOI is currently taking steps to address these flaws, it says it filed the lawsuit because the extent of punitive action taken by RSPO is too extreme and resulted in “commercial and reputational losses”. Gemma Tillack, agribusiness campaign director for RAN, said the lawsuit is a “drastic decision” by company executives, and shows that IOI Group “is digging in its heels rather than truly trying to solve its serious conflict palm oil problem”. In the letter, green groups added that “it is clear that only economic consequences will compel the IOI Group to take responsibility for cleaning up its act”. Major global consumer firms such as Unilever, Mars, Nestle, and Ferrero have already dropped IOI as a supplier, and those that fail to do the same “are taking a major risk by associating their brand reputation with a supplier known to be connected to conflicts with communities, exploitation of workers and the ongoing clearing and burning of natural forests,” added Tillack. The letter by the NGO coalition - made up of organisations including Transformasi untuk Keadilan Indonesia (TuK INDONESIA), US-based Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Greenpeace, and the Union of Concerned Scientists - also laid out conditions that IOI must meet to put an end to the calls for a boycott.These included dropping the legal case against RSPO, immediately halting all plantation development and expansion until a proper land assessment has identified forest conservation areas, and investing resources into rehabilitating all the peatlands and forest the company has burnt and degraded. The NGOs also pointed to a 2014 report by Finnish civil society organisation Finnwatch outlining labour exploitation and conflict with indigenous communities, and said that IOI must tackle these abuses immediately. Ivy Schlegel, Greenpeace United States spokesperson, said that “whatever IOI was hoping to achieve through this lawsuit has backfired, with even more of its customers now deserting the company”. “Instead of trying to bully its critics, IOI should stop creating the conditions for forest fires by trashing Indonesia’s peatlands”.

The debt restructuring agreements were negotiated after APP in 2001 defaulted on a massive dollarsUS13.9 billion of debt and was delisted by the New York and Singapore stock exchanges.The 2004 agreements covered the restructuring of dollars6 billion in debt to the taxpayer-backed export credit agencies of Germany, Japan, France, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Spain and Denmark. Under the agreement, APP – part of the giant Sinar Mas conglomerate - also promised to be fully sustainable by 2007, something it defined as producing all pulp exclusively from plantation wood. The company described the agreements as a “legally binding contractual obligation”. The Eyes on the Forest investigation shows that 2007 was the year APP’s wood suppliers began clearing the very areas of high conservation value forest in central Sumatra’s Pulau Muda that had been highlighted by APP as an example of a new “scientific basis for the sustainable development of our plantations and the management of our conservation areas”.“Despite APP’s praise for the independent mapping of the high conservation value forest in the Pulau Muda rainforest, our analysis of recent satellite imagery shows a third of the identified 34,000 hectares has now been drained and cleared,” said Muslim Rasyid, co-ordinator of Jikalahari (Forest Rescue Network Raiu), a member of Eyes on the Forest.Much of this clearing was legally questionable on other grounds, being on peat of more than four metres deep which when drained gives off colossal carbon emissions.Promises cannot be trusted“Even in legally binding agreements with government-backed credit institutions around the world, APP has demonstrated that its promises cannot be trusted,” said Rod Taylor, Director of WWF International’s Forest Programme. “In just the last couple of months, it’s been revealed that APP and affiliates have cleared inside a self-declared tiger sanctuary, that the company has made claims about sustainability certifications that its certifiers reject, and that protected timber species are present in supplies to its pulp mills.”APP has missed self-imposed deadlines of 2004, 2007, and 2009 of supplying its pulp mills exclusively from renewable plantation wood. An announcement it would finally fulfil this promise by 2015 was recently amended to a new deadline of 2020 – when there is a risk there will be little forest left in Sumatra. Eyes on the Forest calls on the ECAs and other investors to not finance APP’s plans to expand existing or open new pulp and paper mills in Indonesia, in China and around the world.“WWF urges taxpayers to tell their export credit agencies to stop supporting the destruction of Sumatran and other tropical forests and driving elephants, tigers and orang-utans to local extinction,” said Nazir Foead, Conservation Director WWF-Indonesia.”This is a company that defaulted on its debts and defaulted on the environmental covenants it agreed to as a condition of restructuring its debts. Any support to its plans to expand risks history repeating itself, with any new pulp mills adding to the over-capacity driving the assault on Sumatra’s natural forests and wildlife.“This is not a business model that should be financed by any prudent financial institution or investor for replication in Borneo, Papua or anywhere else.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |       -0.95509|\n",

GAR hopes that at least ten “key growers” in Indonesia and GAPKI will adopt high carbon stock conservation policies by the time the next phase of its commitment is rolled out.To date, GAPKI has bristled at policies that would put any restrictions on Indonesia’s <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> industry, but now that two of the world’s largest traders have made high profile commitments and the Indonesian government is in its third year of a moratorium on new concessions in peatlands and primary forests, the body is facing unprecedented pressure to set basic standards. The apparent shift comes at a critical time for the industry, which is finally seeing a rally in the price of <mark style=\"background-color: red\">palm oil</mark> after a two-year lull. While macroeconomic factors have driven price fluctuations, the industry is facing growing criticism in some markets over the impact of its expansion on wildlife-rich forests and carbon-dense peatlands.

The company, which supplies 40% of the world’s palm oil, made a new pledge on Monday (10 December) to ensure that its supply chains are classed as “deforestation-free” by 2020 – a commitment which builds on its 2013 “no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation” (NPDE) sustainability strategy.  In order to achieve the new goal, Wilmar International will carry out a supplier audit by the end of January 2019, with all suppliers found to be driving forest loss then facing “immediate” suspension.The company will also invest in satellite software and technology, which will be used to monitor supplier farms from above, therefore ensuring transparency and compliance.<mark><mark style=\"background-color: red\">Wilmar International’s chairman</mark> and chief executive Kuok Khoon Hong said in a statement that he felt “compelled” to bolster the company’s sustainability ambitions in light of recent research suggesting that palm oil-led deforestation is rising globally</mark>.“We have a shared responsibility with the rest of the upstream and downstream industry players as well as consumer goods companies and NGOs to prioritize forest protection at the heart of our operations,” the statement reads.“We will make progress in moving the industry through the implementation of these stricter controls.”Wilmar International notably supplies palm oil to factories producing products for a number of big-name consumer goods and food and drink firms, including Unilever, Proctor & Gamble and Mondelez International.Green economy reactionThe announcement from Wilmar International was welcomed by Greenpeace, which has been actively campaigning against the firm’s 2013 policy for several years, claiming it was “insufficient” to tackle deforestation and modern slavery in palm oil supply chains.The green group’s global head of Indonesian forests campaigns Kiki Taufik confirmed that Greenpeace will “pause” this campaign in order to give Wilmar International time to put the new plan into place.“As the world wakes up to the climate and extinction crisis, inaction is not an option,” Taufik said.“Wilmar has taken an important step and must now put its plan into action immediately. If Wilmar keeps its word, by the end of 2019 it will be using satellites to monitor all of its palm oil suppliers, making it almost impossible for them to get away with forest destruction.”The move was also welcomed by WWF’s commodities lead Emma Keller, who said the use of satellite monitoring could help the palm oil industry take a “huge step forward” in eliminating unsustainable practices from supply chains.\"Produced the right way, palm oil doesn’t have to cause the destruction of forests that provide homes to orangutans, tigers and elephants,” Keller said.“As one of the world’s largest palm oil companies, Wilmar has a key role to play in stopping unsustainable palm oil from finding its way into supply chains and ultimately onto the shelves of our supermarkets. “Palm oil awarenessPalm oil appears in more than 50% of all supermarket products, from confectionary to cosmetics, but the commodity is linked to environmental destruction in global supply chains. Expanding palm oil and wood pulp plantations are the biggest drivers of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia, where many species, including the orangutan, are being threatened with extinction.In a bid to tackle the issue, firms such as Unilever have moved to source palm oil certified as “deforestation-free” in recent months, with the multinational having struck a deal with a government-owned palm oil plantation firm in Indonesia to create a support framework that enables local mills and smallholders to produce palm oil according to zero-deforestation and zero-peatland-deterioration standards this year.Supermarket Iceland, meanwhile, has adopted a different approach, removing palm oil from its own-brand products altogether. The company’s activism in this field has earned much attention and praise from the UK public and the media – particularly after its deforestation-focused Christmas advert was blocked from TV over concerns it was “too political”.More than 800,000 people have signed a petition demanding regulators allow the Iceland advert, called “Rang-Tan”, to be aired on TV.However, the CDP has warned that shifting away from palm oil to other commodities such as rapeseed or coconut oil could actually cause more extensive deforestation and pose greater risks of water stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |        0.31495|\n",

It’s been a big undertaking, mapping 300 direct suppliers and 1,400 mills, looking not just at where palm oil enters Unilever’s supply chain, but the processors, middle men and agents along the chain.Traditional commercial sensitivities and the complexity of the supply chain mean Unilever has had to persevere to get to where it is now, stating that “complete transparency” is required for radical transformation.It’s a similar story at the world’s biggest food business, Nestlé, which also now discloses its list of palm oil suppliers, an initiative of which “top management is fully

For 5 long years workers at the Unilever factory in Doom Dooma, Assam, India have been denied the right to freely choose the union they wish to represent them to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment. An agreement signed between the IUF and Unilever under the auspices of the UK government in 2010 set out procedures for rectifying this situation. Workers were to be given the possibility to choose their union in conditions of security and anonymity; the results were to be verified by a mutually-agreed third-party. The majority union would negotiate the new collective agreement when the one stitched up between management and the union they created in the course of the brutal 2007 lockout expired this year.This was a straightforward commitment from Unilever, with ample time for implementation. Since the agreement was signed, Unilever management has engaged in an endless series of delays and provocations to ensure that this agreement would not be implemented. Most recently, on June 19, Unilever Indian management orchestrated a dangerous provocation to show its contempt for the workers, their union and the agreement signed with the IUF. The company is preparing to sign a new agreement with an illegitimate organization to lock in the denial of rights for at least another 4 years.On June 20, the IUF lodged a formal complaint with the UK National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises, holding Unilever to account for its serial violations of human rights. This latest complaint against Unilever brings to 10 the number of cases filed against this company for violations of the Guidelines, making it the corporate record holder.The IUF will fight with all available resources to ensure that the rights of its members in Doom Dooma, as elsewhere, are fully respected.

Greenpeace filmed in March and April in a rainforest area in Indonesia-and devastated it to an unimaginable extent. For a palm oil plantation, a company has destroyed a hectare of forest area-it is apparently supplied by Nestlé, Mars, PepsiCo and Unilever. It's footage that's affected. From a helicopter perspective, a team from Greenpeace shows what is currently happening in Indonesia: a company produces large areas of rainforest in the province of Papua-it is preparing a new palm oil plantation. A total of 5000 hectares of rainforest were destroyed-one area half as large as Paris. Part of the rainforest stands still, the contrast between the dense green forest on the one hand and the reddish brown surface with broken trunks on the other side is particularly depressing. Palm oil industry is looking for new areas \"After they have destroyed much of Sumatra and Kalimantan's rainforests, the palm oil industry is now pushing into new areas like Papua,\" says Richard George of Greenpeace UK. In this case, it is the \"Hayel Saeed Anam Group\" (HSA-Group)-a multi-group which, according to Greenpeace, supplies the major food industry groups: Nestlé, Mars, PepsiCo and Unilever.All four companies have actually issued directives that they should not use palm oil for which rainforest has been cut. The reality is evidently different, as the British \"Guardian\" formerly beklagte.Nestlé, Unilever, Mars and Co. have the responsibility of themselves \" brands have already been talking about a decade of wanting to clean up their palm oil. Companies like Unilever and Nestlé claim to be leaders in the industry. Why are they still buying from forest destroyer like the HSA group?\", says Richard George of Greenpeace.The big companies blame the blame for deforestation and other scandals on palm oil plantations over and over again and again. There is also something about it: because of the complex production and supply chains, it is not always easy to understand the areas in which palm oil has been purchased and whether forests have been cut down.

[1]To this day, the mercury-tainted factory site continues to leak the deadly neurotoxin into the environment and the forests nearby, even though the factory has been closed for seventeen years. Local activists and non-profit groups have called on Unilever to clean up its mess, [2] but so far their calls are falling on deaf ears.If Unilever dumped a deadly neurotoxin somewhere in Europe that made people sick and destroyed the environment, authorities would demand Unilever clean up the site to proper standards. But since the damage was done far away in the developing world and involves marginalised communities, Unilever is refusing to clean up to standards that we, as Europeans, would be afforded.Late last year, in attempts to appease locals, Unilever used a substandard clean-up process that likely ended up releasing more mercury into the environment than it recovered. [3] This would never have even been allowed in Europe!Unilever is a European company, so as Europeans we are uniquely placed to speak out against this double-standard, and to hold Unilever to account. Local and international pressure has been mounting over the past year, and if Unilever is faced with a mobilisation here at home, they'll have to take real action to avoid losing face. With our help, Kodaikanal could be a healthy, habitable place once again.Indian activists have already achieved what they thought was unthinkable: after 15 years of campaigning, Unilever finally caved and agreed to compensate workers at the site for being poisoned with mercury. [4] But the forest in Kodaikanal is still suffering. Paul Polman, Unilever’s CEO, committed to cleaning up the factory site. [5] But these have remained empty words.

These kinds of false solutions, which are not environmentally friendly, are what put us in this mess in the first place. We need Nestle to innovate away from the single use-model entirely. While today’s announcement is a step in the right direction, the company needs to scale up its efforts toward reusable systems rather than grasping at a quick fix that could cause further environmental disaster such as deforestation.”

Three months ago, the council had sent a come clean ultimatum to Sinarmas, one of the world’s largest paper companies, and its billionaire Indonesian family owners.The conglomerate said Thursday that it has hired an accounting firm to carry out a “comprehensive assessment” of all industrial forest plantation companies in Indonesia that would be supervised by The Forest Trust, a corporate backed group that says it promotes transparency in supply chains. Its members include Asia Pulp & Paper. The assessment would resolve “ongoing and unsubstantiated allegations of using opaque ownership structures,” Sinarmas said.The FSC mark, a stylized tree, is sought by paper producers and other wood users as an endorsement they can use in the marketplace to promote their products as “green” and charge a premium. It is especially crucial for access to the lucrative North American market.The group’s suspension of its endorsement for Sinarmas comes after investigations by The Associated Press and the environmental news site Mongabay showed extensive ties between Sinarmas and plantation companies that the conglomerate had either denied any involvement with or described as independent suppliers.One of those companies was cutting down tropical forest in West Kalimantan that was a habitat for critically endangered Bornean orangutans, a violation of the conglomerate’s 2013 vow to end deforestation. Greenpeace, which had been advising Sinarmas on conservation, cut ties with the conglomerate.Separately, on Wednesday, conservation groups released a report based on government wood utilization data that showed Asia Pulp & Paper had purchased wood from two plantation companies that have cleared a combined 32,000 hectares of natural forest since 2013. It also said another Indonesian conglomerate, Asia Pacific Resources International, usually known as April, had done the same.The purchased wood was plantation grown, not natural forest. But the conservation groups said both companies were violating their no-deforestation promises because they were taking wood grown on land where the natural forest is being progressively cut down.Asia Pulp & Paper said it had “quarantined” at one of its mills about 800 truckloads of wood bought from Fajar Surya Swadaya.It said the purchase was an administrative lapse that occurred before an inspection of the plantation showed the operator didn’t understand what is known as “high conservation stock” and was cutting down natural forest. April, meanwhile, said the plantation had done a conservation assessment in April 2015 and based on this, the development wasn’t done in a forest with high conservation value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |       -0.56571|\n",

Egyptian cotton, which can be spun into fine, long fiber to make sheets with a high thread count, is synonymous with luxury bedding. But in the last four months, it’s been at the center of a controversy that has caused many Americans to wonder whether the Egyptian cotton sheets they rely on for a good night’s sleep actually contain any cotton from Egypt.The controversy involves Welspun India, a giant home textile manufacturer. Target, Walmart and a handful of other big US retailers have pulled hundreds of thousands of bedding sheets off shelves after discovering that Welspun had sold them falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products.Welspun has seen its stock price tumble since Target led the defection in August when an investigation by the retailer found the 750,000 sheets and pillow cases that Welspun labeled as 100% Egyptian cotton were actually fake. Bed, Bath & Beyond, also one of Welspun’s top customers, is the latest to stop selling the manufacturer’s 100% Egyptian cotton sheets, Bloomberg reported.Welspun, which sells its goods in more than 50 countries and generated $871.4m in annual revenue, is now facing consumer lawsuits over the fake sheets. Most recently, a suit was filed against Walmart, alleging that the store knew about the problem for years but didn’t pull the sheets until two months ago.The trouble Welspun is in demonstrates both the difficulties of monitoring a supply chain that stretches around the world and the power of a label to entice consumers to pay more for products they perceive to be superior. The Egyptian cotton label doesn’t present a verified claim of quality – all it signifies is that the cotton is grown in Egypt. The connection to luxury comes from the recognition that the cotton makes for strong, soft and tightly woven fabric. There are around 10 varieties of cotton farmed in Egypt, according to the US Department of Agriculture.The trouble of verifying a product’s origin and quality pops up in many products, not just bedding. It’s fairly common in the food business: Whole Foods and Safeway, for example, are among the major supermarkets that have gotten in trouble for selling extra virgin oil from Italy that didn’t meet either claim.Welspun is now facing a credibility check from one of the industry groups it belongs to: the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), an international group that aims to promote the production of sustainable cotton. Part of the BCI’s role is to set standards to ensure the cotton its members use is in fact sustainably grown and harvested. Matthew Kempen, a spokesperson for the initiative, noted that the phrase “Egyptian cotton” is more of an indicator of quality and sustainability, and that BCI, which includes Ralph Lauren, Nike and Levi Strauss as members, doesn’t verify the origins of cotton.“As a matter of precaution we shall be contacting Welspun about the incident to request that they share their corrective actions with us, and we shall remind them that members contribute to credibility of BCI as a framework,” said Kempen.Dishonesty hurts a brand’s reputation as well as sales, said Tulin Erdem, a business and marketing professor who specializes in brand reputation management at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Welspun’s shares dropped by nearly 43% in the week following the announcement from Target, which was the manufacturer’s second largest customer and accounted for $90m, or 10% of the company’s business, in the fiscal year that ended in March.Retailers play a part in ensuring consumers get what they’re paying for. Although it can be difficult to track every manufacturer’s claim, retailers have a responsibility to take action promptly when they suspect dishonesty, said Erdem.Walmart’s actions – and whether it reacted quickly enough to protect its customers –are also under scrutiny. The lawsuit against Walmart claims that the company first became suspicious of Welspun’s Egyptian cotton label back in 2008, but only pulled the product off its shelves in September, after Target announced it was doing the same. Walmart declined to comment.Target said it was phasing out all products manufactured by Welspun under the “Fieldcrest” label after an investigation revealed sheets produced by the company between August 2014 and July 2016 used non-Egyptian cotton.“Retailers with a good reputation should be vigilant about whether the claimed quality is indeed the delivered quality,” Erdem said. “The decisions about what brands to carry need to be made carefully, and that is part of quality management for a manufacturer.”Welspun did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. The company said in a statement in September to shareholders that it had hired an accounting firm to investigate its cotton suppliers. “We take the current traceability concerns around some of our product lines very seriously,” the company said.Welspun said the products under investigation represented 6% of the company’s annual business, and its deal with Walmart accounted for 1.5% of annual sales.The dwindling supply of Egyptian cotton could be a factor that leads cotton suppliers to cheat. Egyptian cotton production has been on a steady decline over the past decade as the global price for cotton has dropped and the Egyptian government has removed subsidies to help farmers.According to the US Department of Agriculture, Egypt is expected to produce 395,000 bales of cotton in 2017, down from nearly 940,000 bales in 2005.While verifying claims on labels can be challenging, technology is making it easier for retailers to at least check the reputation of certain brands, said Erdem. A laboratory outside New York City offers DNA testing to verify whether textiles are made of premium cotton. If they are, a tiny barcode is sprayed on the cotton before it is turned into yarn, allowing it to be tracked throughout the production process.“Certain claims are almost not verifiable, such as whether a certain cream delays the onset of wrinkles in the long run,” said Erdem. “But some others are easier to verify, such as the origin of the main raw material.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       -0.35108|\n",
