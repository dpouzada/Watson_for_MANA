Il motivo principale riguarda probabilmente il desiderio di distaccarsi da quanto, in campo alimentare, viene offerto da parte delle pi_ notemultinazionali, che spesso utilizzano materie prime provenienti da coltivazioni in cui non viene tenuto conto n̩ della salvaguardia dell'ambiente, n̩ del rispetto dei lavoratori dal punto di vista etico. Come si dovrebbero comportare i consumatori nel momento in cui le multinazionali iniziassero adestendere i propri tentacolinel mondo del biologico?Si tratta di un fenomeno che purtroppo starebbe gi avvenendo da alcuni anni, con particolare riferimento agliStati Uniti. Alcune delle pi_ note multinazionali alimentari avrebbero infatti la tendenza ad affiancare alle proprie linee di produzione tradizionale, delle nuove categorie di prodottipresentati e pubblicizzati come biologici,il ricavato delle cui vendite sarebbe in ogni caso destinato adarricchire le multinazionali stesse, che in ambiti differenti dal ""bio"" andrebbero ad agire secondo le consuetudini abituali, utilizzando, ad esempio, ingredienti provenienti da agricoltura intensiva, con la possibilit di incorrere nell'impiego di OGM.Tale questione ̬ stata recentemente sollevata da undossier apparso sul New York Times, che pone chiaramente in luce quali siano lemultinazionali statunitensiche starebbero in un certo qual modo sfruttando il desiderio da parte dei consumatori di alimentarsi scegliendocibi sani con ingredienti provenienti da agricoltura biologica, proponendo prodotti certificati come biologici, ma spesso contenenti ingredienti provenienti dall'altro capo del mondo. possibile dunque fidarsi di prodotti biologici in vendita presso i supermercati (anche nel nostro Paese) che in realt contengono ingredienti provenienti da stati extraeuropei, che dunque hanno compiutocentinaia di chilometriper giungere sulle nostre tavole e che potrebbero non essere stati sottoposti ai medesimi controlli vigenti in Europa? Scegliere alimenti biologici dovrebbe significare anche esprimere la propria preferenza per quei cibi realizzati impiegandoingredienti di provenienza locale(affidandosi dunque direttamente alle aziende agricole biologiche della zona in cui si vive) o scegliere prodotti che siano realmente realizzati nelrispetto dell'ambiente e dei lavoratori, sebbene le materie prime impiegate all'interno di essi provengano dall'estero (commercio equo e solidale).Secondo il New York Times, note multinazionali statunitensi, tra cui si trovanoCoca-Cola, Cargill, ConAgra, General Mills,KrafteM&amp.M Mars, si sarebbero impadronite della maggior parte delmercato industriale del biologico nazionale, generando dunque una vera e propriaconfusionenei consumatori, tramite la creazione di linee di prodotti biologici dietro i quali si nascondono per_ i soliti temuti ""giganti"".Per quanto riguarda lasituazione italiana, la tendenza emersa dall'ultimo Sana riguarda un deciso incremento delle vendite da parte del mercato del biologico, un dato legato per_ alladiminuzione del numero di aziende biologicheitaliane, in quanto le realt pi_ piccole sarebbero state inglobate dai marchi maggiori o sarebbero scomparse schiacciate da essi.

I consumatori considerano l'acquisto di tali prodotti realmente vantaggioso? I prezzi non risultano sempre abbordabili, ma probabilmente, al fine di alimentarsi in maniera sana, essi sarebbero disposti a spendere un po'di pi_.Il suggerimento finale rimane in ogni caso quello di preferire il pi_ possibileprodotti biologici di origine locale, achilometri zero, la cui provenienza sia certa e la cui produzione non sia sottoposta al dominio di multinazionali interessate unicamente al mero profitto economico.Marta Alb̬";"Because consumers choose to contact the purchase diprodotti organic ?

How you should lead to consumers when the multinationals began adestendere their own tentacolinel world of organic ?It is a phenomenon that unfortunately is already happening for some years, with particular reference agliStati United. Some of the most well-known multinational food would indeed the tendency to assist in their traditional production lines, the new categories of prodottipresentati and advertised as organic, the proceeds of which sales would be in any case intended adarricchire the corporations themselves, in different scopes from the "" bio should be to act according to the usual practice, using, for example, ingredients from intensive agriculture, with the possibility of incurring The use of GMOs.This issue was recently raised by undossier that appeared in the New York Times, which clearly puts light which are lemultinazionali statunitensiche would be in a way by exploiting the desire on the part of consumers to feed scegliendocibi with healthy ingredients from organic farming, proposing products certified as organic, but often containing ingredients from the other side of the world.You can then trust organic products for sale at the supermarkets (also in our country) that actually contain ingredients from non-European states, so they compiutocentinaia to chilometriper arrive on our boards and that might not have been subjected to the same controls in force in Europe ? Choose organic food should also mean to express your preference for those foods made impiegandoingredienti of local origin (relying so directly to organic farms in the area where you live) or choose products are actually made nelrispetto of the environment and workers, although the raw materials used within them come from abroad (fair trade and solidarity).According to the New York Times, notes multinational U.S., including you trovanoCoca-Cola, Cargill, ConAgra, General Mills, KrafteM &amp.

""Alexandre Bompard should announce its plan on November 23, it was rejected, because they feared a mobilization during the balances,"" said c̩g̩tiste.

Under its mandate, more than a thousand posts had been removed to increase profits.A billion euros in profits, 500 million dividends A Carrefour, purging should be much more violent. To face a strong competition from other major surfaces as the sale online, the string has decreased prices, lowering its rate margin to 1.1%. A cost-effectiveness considered insufficient by the shareholders. Supported by more than 100 million tax relief each year through the Credit Taxes Jobs Competitiveness (IECC), the group has yet achieved in 2016 more a billion euros in profits. In June 2017, the general meeting of the chain has decided to donate half forms of dividends &#8211. or the modest sum of 500 million euros.""We, we had the right to 80 million euros, to redistribute between 100 000 employees"", notes, bitter, Denis Tizon, CGT union representative of the logistics platform Le Mans.

""In 2008, it was 330 to work in the Carrefour centreAlma,"" said Benjamin Gouezigoux. ""Today, it is 240"".Employees describe reserves full, palettes that roam without having the time to check. ""We are in the going fast, the time to do our tasks, implement radius, view prices or verify the dates"", summarizes a striker. ""When a cashier will revolt, it is the level of fresh rays"" Faced with this situation, some customers are restless, until insult cashiers. One of them had to be stopped, after a umpteenth slippage. The pressure frameworks, it, is much more insidious. ""We are taking remarks, we are told that it is we organize, fails to comply with the instructions"", describes a striker. It continues: ""In each radius, pressure, I am told that it will not ask anything if you don't want to work on Sundays"". When there is not enough volunteers for the weekend, some heads of rays draw lots employees who will work.""When a cashier will revolt, it highlights the cases, because there are rays costs and that it is more cold,"" describes Denis Tizon. Other means of coercion to silence dissenting voices: working hours, which can ruin a family life. ""Just put a median break two hours,"" sighed a cashier.In the store, away from the eyes of clients, constraints are more visible. ""They urged us, we face it,"" said an employee. The striker describes scenes humiliating: ""it takes a worker, is in the middle of the arena, and it hung above, in front of everyone"". The least successful are being gap, ""to give ground to this pressure,"" the warning e-mails pose the threat of dismissal. This is not like that in each store, temporizes-. ""But Alma, it has always existed.""In the logistical platforms, the situation is not more advantageous. The new objectives have a name: versatility.

Those Underproduction are placed at the positions most painful, older, Commission, are being competition with the acting, younger.Burn for 1 200 euros per month Result: employees crack, one after the other. Some are work stoppage, others are burn, fall into depression. ""I replace a colleague who is in depression for six months,"" notes, bitter, a striker. ""For another, it lasted three years."" After working for 29 years in the Carrefour Rennes Centre Alma, a cashier has resigned, following a depression. ""It's impossible to find a job after that,"" deplore his former colleagues.While the police join the strikers to ask if they intend to block the large surface, the director of the store approach. He complains: ""it is unfortunate that it happens on December 23"", at the time of the last races Christmas. Faced with various testimonies of strikers, it denies block, ducking. A little further, other executives drink their coffee on the terrace of a restaurant, observe the dam filtering alongside a bailiff. ""They have received as logs not inflame things,"" said Benjamin Gouezigoux.""The executives say that it was right off,"" said Denis Tizon. ""But meeting, they deny everything that you said."" The premiums variables that are awarded based on their results to increase always invite more productivity of their subordinates. ""They earn their premiums through our work"", continues a cashier. ""I, side, I win 1 200 euros per month.""A salary still too high for the distributor. It promotes the development lease stewardship of its stores less profitable, Betton, Ille-et-Vilaine. In leaving the group, the employees lose the protection of their collective agreement. ""It was calculated that we lose about 20% of our salary,"" said a worker concerned.

5979e6b59ad5885bf96d42df;R1630;social; Bruxelles, les tats membres sont encore plus complaisants avec les lobbys que la CommissionSource :ALTER-EUInfluenceOn parle beaucoup, et avec raison, de l&#8217.omnipr̩sence des lobbys au sein des institutions bruxelloises et de leur influence sur les politiques europ̩ennes. Une ̩tude men̩e par la coalition ALTER-EU sugg̬re que la palme de la complaisance envers les lobbys revient en r̩alit̩ aux tats membres eux-m̻mes,  travers leurs repr̩sentations nationales  Bruxelles. La France se distingue par son opacit̩.Bruxelles n&#8217.abrite pas seulement la Commission et le Parlement europ̩en. Chaque tat membre de l&#8217.Union est aussi pr̩sent dans la capitale europ̩enne  travers sa repr̩sentation permanente, l۪̩quivalent d۪une ambassade. Les lobbyistes admettent depuis longtemps que ces repr̩sentations nationales, charg̩es d&#8217.assurer le lien entre tats membres et institutions europ̩ennes, constituent une cible de choix :&#171. Tout ce dont vous avez besoin est d&#8217.identifier le bon fonctionnaire, et vous ̻tes en contact ̩troit avec le lieu le plus important et le plus influent o_ se formulent les politiques europ̩ennes. C&#8217.est comme ̤a que l&#8217.on peut faire passer des messages aupr̬s du Conseil des ministres, et c&#8217.est consid̩rablement moins cher que d&#8217.avoir affaire aux pays membres dans chaque capitale.&#187. Lesr̩v̩lations duGuardianapr̬s le scandale Volkswagen, selon lesquelles la France, l۪Allemagne et le Royaume-Uni ont fait pression aupr̬s de la Commission pour ne pas remettre en cause les tests d̩ficients d۪̩missions des automobiles, en constituent une illustration ̩clatante.Pourtant, les repr̩sentations nationales  Bruxelles ne sont pas soumises aux r̬gles de transparence et d۪acc̬s  l۪information que les institutions europ̩ennes elles-m̻mes . chacune est r̩gie par son propre droit national, souvent plus limit̩ que le droit europ̩en. En France, c۪est la loi de 1978 sur l۪acc̬s aux documents administratifs, dont on sait toutes les limites, qui s۪applique. Si les r̬gles de transparence et d۪encadrement du lobbying  Bruxelles sont tr̬s insuffisantes, on est encore loin de pouvoir disposer, en France, de l۪̩quivalent desinformations contenues dans le registre europ̩en des porteurs d۪int̩r̻tsou encore de celles sur les rendez-vous entre dirigeants de la Commission et lobbyistes compil̩s sur le siteintegritywatch.eu[1].Comme on pouvait s۪y attendre, les lobbyistes bruxellois profitent  plein de cette situation. L۪̩tude (accessibleicien anglais) r̩alis̩e par la coalition ALTER-EU en collaboration avec plusieurs partenaires, dont l۪Observatoire des multinationales pour la France, est la premi̬re tentative de tenter d۪y voir plus clair dans le lobbying exerc̩ aupr̬s des repr̩sentants nationaux  Bruxelles, et ses r̩sultats sont ̩difiants. Pour Vicky Cann, du Corporate Europe Observatory,&#171. ce rapport d̩montre le niveau inqui̩tant de lobbying qui s&#8217.exerce aupr̬s des repr̩sentations permanentes aupr̬s de l&#8217.UE. Ces ̩manations des gouvernements nationaux jouent un r̫le important dans les processus de prise de d̩cision de l&#8217.UE, mais de mani̬re largement souterraine, ce qui en fait une cible id̩al pour les lobbyistes des grandes entreprises. &#187.Concr̬tement, il a ̩t̩ demand̩  chaque repr̩sentation nationale  Bruxelles de fournir une liste des rendez-vous organis̩s au cours de l۪ann̩e ̩coul̩e avec des repr̩sentants de porteurs d۪int̩r̻t, avec le nom des personnes pr̩sentes et les th̬mes abord̩s  autant d۪informations que la Commission europ̩enne est tenue de fournir de mani̬re automatique, et qui est abondamment exploit̩e par la soci̩t̩ civile pour suivre, et autant que possible contrebalancer, l۪influence des lobbys sur les politiques europ̩ennes.En l۪occurrence, la plupart des repr̩sentations nationales ont r̩pondu qu۪elles ne disposaient pas d۪une telle liste  autrement dit qu۪elles ne jugeaient pas n̩cessaires de garder la trace de leurs rencontres avec des lobbyistes. D۪autres, plus sinc̬res peut-̻tre, ont carr̩ment refus̩ de r̩v̩ler ces informations . c۪est le cas du Royaume-Uni et de Malte. Les derni̬res, parmi lesquelles la France[2], ont tout bonnement refus̩ de r̩pondre quoi que ce soit. Bonjour la transparence !Au final, seules l۪Irlande, la Roumanie, les Pays-Bas et la Pologne auront donc r̩v̩l̩ certaines informations (partielles) sur les r̩unions organis̩es avec des lobbyistes, et ces informations donnent sans doute une bonne id̩e de ce que les autres pays refusent de rendre public. Par exemple, comme c۪est le cas pour les institutions europ̩ennes elles-m̻mes, la grande majorit̩ de leurs r̩unions avec des lobbyistes concernaient des repr̩sentants d۪int̩r̻ts ̩conomiques (plus de 60%), et seule une minorit̩ des organisations de la soci̩t̩ civile. Autre constat : une proportion non n̩gligeable des lobbyistes ou des organisations cit̩s dans ces documents ne sont pas enregistr̩s au registre officiel europ̩en des porteurs d۪int̩r̻ts (inscription qui reste largement facultative).Paradoxalement, les entreprises &#171. rencontr̩es &#187. par les repr̩sentations des tats membres  Bruxelles ne sont pas majoritairement des entreprises nationales (sauf dans le cas des Pays-Bas, qui d̩clarent avoir surtout rencontr̩ Shell, Phillips, KLM et Unilever). La Roumanie a ainsi signal̩ toute une s̩rie de r̩unions autour de la r̩forme du march̩ europ̩en du carbone, avec les lobbys du ciment, de la chimie, de l۪aluminium et des carburants, ainsi qu۪avec des firmes comme Alstom et ArcelorMittal. Ce pays est-il particuli̬rement cibl̩ sur ce sujet, ou bien toutes les repr̩sentations nationales ont-elles abrit̩ des r̩unions similaires ? Impossible de le savoir. Autres entreprises cit̩es par les repr̩sentants roumains : le groupe de d̩fense fran̤ais Thales, ExxonMobil, GeneralElectric et Google. Plusieurs pays signalent des r̩unions avec l۪American Chamber of Commerce, principal lobby patronal am̩ricain et grand promoteur du projet de trait̩ Tafta.Pour ce qui est de la France, la transparence n&#8217.est pas encore au rendez-vous[3].Olivier Petitjean&mdash.Photo : Chris Gilson CC[1]Le registre des lobbyistes  l۪Assembl̩e nationale et au S̩nat reste extr̻mement parcellaire (lirenotre article). Le projet de loi Sapin, qui doit ̻tre pr̩sent̩ au Conseil des ministres le 30 mars 2016, contient des dispositions sur l۪encadrement du lobbying aupr̬s du pouvoir ex̩cutif, qui repr̩sentent un progr̬s relatif mais restent elles aussi extr̻mement limit̩es en termes d&#8217.obligations effectives de transparence.[3]On rappellera que le haut repr̩sentant de la France  Bruxelles est Pierre Sellal, qui si̩geait aux conseils d۪administration d۪EDF et Areva et dont la femme ̩tait jusqu۪il y a peu directrice des affaires institutionnelles et europ̩ennes (autrement dit lobbyiste en chef) de Vivendi.[1][2][3];In Brussels, Member States are still more complacent with the lobbies that the Commission Source :ALTER-EU Influence is a lot, and with reason, l&#8217. pervasiveness of lobbies within Brussels institutions and their influence on European policies. A study conducted by the coalition ALTER-EU suggests that the palm of the complacency to lobby is actually the Member States themselves, through their national representations in Brussels. France is distinguished by its opacity.Brussels n&#8217. houses not only the Commission and the European Parliament. Each Member State l&#8217. Union is also present in the European capital through its permanent representation, the equivalent of an embassy. The lobbyists have long recognized that these national representations, loaded d&#8217. ensure the link between Member States and European institutions, are a target of choice: &#171. Everything you need is d&#8217. identify the good servant, and you are in close contact with the place the most important and most influential in formulating European policies. C &#8217. it l&#8217. you can move messages with the Council of Ministers, and c&#8217 is considerably less expensive than d&#8217. have case members in each capital. &#187. Lesr̩v̩lations duGuardianapr̬s scandal Volkswagen, that France, Germany and the United Kingdom have lobbied with the Commission for not question the tests deficient emissions cars, are a vivid illustration.Yet the national representations in Brussels are not subject to the rules of transparency and access to information that the European institutions themselves. each is governed by its own national law, often more limited than European law. In France, it is the law of 1978 on access to administrative documents, known to all limits, which applies. If the rules of transparency and supervision of lobbying in Brussels are very inadequate, is still far from power have, in France, equivalent information contained in the European register of holders of int̩r̻tsou still those on appointments between leaders of the Commission and lobbyists compiled on the siteintegritywatch.eu [ 1 ].As might be expected, lobbyists in Brussels benefit full of this situation. The study (accessibleicien English) conducted by the coalition ALTER-EU in collaboration with several partners, including the Observatory of multinationals for France, is the first attempt to try to see clearer in the lobbying with national representatives in Brussels, and its results are edifying. For Vicky Cann, Corporate Europe Observatory, &# 171. this report demonstrates the alarming level of lobbying that s&#8217 .exerce with permanent representations to l&#8217. EU. These fumes of national governments play an important role in the decision-making process decision l&#8217. EU, but in a largely underground, which makes it a perfect target for lobbyists of big business. &#187. Specifically, were asked to each national representation in Brussels to provide a list of appointments organized during the past year with representatives of holders of interest, with the name of the persons present and themes-all Information that the European Commission is required to provide automatic manner, and is extensively exploited by civil society to monitor, and as far as possible counterbalance, the influence of lobbies on European policies.In this case, most national representations responded that they did not have such a list-in other words they were not required to keep track of their meetings with lobbyists. Others, more sincere, have flatly refused to disclose this information. it is the case of the United Kingdom and Malta. The last, including France [ 2 ], have simply refused to answer anything. Hello transparency!In the end, only Ireland, Romania, the Netherlands and Poland will therefore revealed some information (partial) on meetings organized with lobbyists, and this information is probably a good idea of what other countries refuse to make public. For example, as is the case for the European institutions themselves, the vast majority of their meetings with lobbyists were representatives of economic interests (more than 60%), and only a minority of organizations of civil society. Another observation: a significant proportion of lobbyists or organizations cited in these documents are not registered at the official register of European carriers of interest (registration remains largely optional).Paradoxically, businesses &#171. encountered &#187. by the representations of Member States to Brussels are not mostly national companies (except in the case of the Netherlands, which they mostly met with Shell, Phillips, KLM and Unilever). Romania has well reported a series of meetings around the reform of the European market for carbon, with the lobbies cement, chemistry, aluminum and fuel, as well as with companies such as Alstom and ArcelorMittal. This country is particularly focused on this subject, or all national representations have hosted similar meetings? Unable to know. Other companies cited by the Romanian representatives: the group of French Defence Thales, ExxonMobil, GeneralElectric and Google. Several countries report meetings with the American Chamber of Commerce, the main US business lobby and large proponent of the draft treaty Tafta.As regards France, transparency is not yet at the n&#8217 meeting [ 3 ].Olivier Petitjean &mdash. Photo: Chris Gilson CC [ 1 ] The register of lobbyists in the National Assembly and the Senate remains extremely fragmented (lirenotre article). The bill Sapin, which must be submitted to the Council of Ministers on March 30, 2016, contains provisions on the leadership of the lobbying of the executive, which represent a relative progress but are also extremely limited in terms d&#8217. actual obligations of transparency. [ 3 ] It recalled that the top representative of France in Brussels is Pierre Sellal, who sat on the boards of EDF and Areva and whose wife was until recently Director of Institutional and European Affairs (i.e. lobbyist in chief) of Vivendi.

5979f376819c9e61077752c8;R1717;Social;PagesMonday, 17 August 1998Sustainable ConsumptionAs mentioned in the last newsletter, Sheffield FoE were planning to take part in a day of action as part of the International No-Shop Day. We can now report back that several of our members made an appearance at Meadowhall to get the sustainable consumption message across to the public. Members set up a variety of board games and played musical instruments to highlight alternatives to mass consumption.Sustainable Consumption - Take ActionKeep the pressure up for tough laws to ensure electrical goods are designed for reuse and recycling. FoE have targeted Dixons (the UK&#8217.s largest electrical retailer), but they have not yet responded. When you go shopping in Dixons or Currys (Part of the Dixons group) ask the following 3 questions:Will you take back electrical products at the end of their lives?Will you ensure the parts are reused or recycled?What plans do you have to label products with their expected life-spans so I can buy long lasting ones?Recycling in Sheffield dropsFigures from the Council&#8217.s own performance indicators show that Sheffield is falling well behind on its recycling, no doubt partly as a result of the large capacity wheelie bins issued to most people. The percentage of household waste recycled has fallen from 4.65% in 93/94 to 2.47% in 96/97 while the cost of rubbish disposal has shot up from &#163.7.58 per tonne to &#163.13.35 over the same period. Inevitably the refurbishment of the Bernard Road incinerator to bring it up to EC emission standards and the landfill tax on all rubbish that had to be dumped for a year while it was closed for the  work won&#8217.t have helped (total cost now put at 15M). While closed the properties normally heated by the system had to be heated by the back-up gas boiler.At the December Green Party meeting the Council&#8217.s recycling officer admitted that the proceeds from the landfill tax  is likely to go to &#8216.attractive&#8217. causes such as tree planting when money really needs to be spent on better recycling facilities. It is now well documented that there is no real incentive to increase recycling in Sheffield because this could undermine the viability of the incinerator and the associated district heating scheme. (Taken from Greensheaf)Recycling - Did You Know?Did you know that the UK&#8217.s Christmas cards and wrapping paper this year used the equivalent of around a quarter of a million trees?Out of every &#163.75 pounds spent on groceries, &#163.10 is for the packaging?A returnable container system for drinks could create up to 4,000 jobs in the UK?Food NewsUnilever are now labelling one of their smaller brand names, Bachelors Beanfeast (or should that be Genebeast?), as containing genetically engineered soya. As Unilever tests the water for public reaction, FoE have been warning people to watch out for this small label and also to be aware of other brands which Unilever might be thinking about using GE ingredients.However, on a positive note, as of 1 May, Iceland supermarkets&#8217. own brand products will be free of all genetically engineered ingredients. The tough stance was outlined at a press conference on 18 March in London. FoE supports this position and urges all other supermarkets to follow Iceland.Forests &amp. Paper CampaignFinnish company UPM-Kymmene, major paper suppliers to the UK and involved in using wood from the last old forests in Finland, has further demonstrated its lack of commitment to the environment by announcing a joint venture with an Indonesian company APRIL. The venture will involve clear-felling logged-over natural forest in Indonesia and replacing it with industrial monoculture plantation. The APRIL enterprise is also involved in a dispute with a local village who are claiming compensation for loss of their land to the company. FoE groups in Finland, the Netherlands and the UK are launching a campaign calling on UPM-Kymmene to pull out of the deal.Meanwhile, several old-growth forests in Finland were logged in the past few months. UPM-Kymmene is believed to have bought wood from at least some of the old-growth areas. UPM Kymmene supplies paper to IPC Magazines (publishers of New Scientist, Marie Claire etc.) and BBC Magazines (publishers of Radio Times and BBC Wildlife). UPM-Kymmene is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, a group of companies supposedly committed to sustainable development, which doesn&#8217.t square with either clear-felling rainforest, or destroying the last old-growth forests in Finland.To take action write to UPM-Kymmene&#8217.s president, Mr Juha Niemel_a at PO Box 203, FIN-00171 Helsinki, Finland. Say that as a UK paper consumer you urge them to show their commitment to sustainable development by withdrawing from the deal with APRIL and declaring a moratorium on using wood from Finland&#8217.s last old-growth forests.Campaign News from Local GroupsLeeds Friends of the Earth&#8217.s Wild Woods Campaigners took to the street with a petition calling for the newspaper industry to buy more recycled paper. This very vocal day of action drew a lot of attention and filled the petition sheets in record time.Thorne and Hatfield Moors have retained their status as Sites of Special Scientific Interest, despite plans to remove the designation by English Nature at the end of last year. FoE local groups, particular in the north east, quickly responded to a call for action at Conference in September and threw themselves into the fight to save the MoorsNear Doncaster - the last surviving lowland raised peat bog in England. Without a local group in the immediate area, Robin Maynard and Matt Phillips from FoE attended and spoke at a public meeting organised by the local authority. There are now murmurings of a new FoE group in Doncaster.Frankenstein masks and lab coats were the order of the day for groups in the West Yorkshire FoE Network who quizzed local shoppers about their choices, and cheered and shook hands with shoppers leaving Safeways for taking part in the &#8220.biggest genetic experiment&#8221..;

L&#8217.explication r̩side sans doute dans l&#8217.une des principales annonces faites par Trump au lendemain des ̩lections : un plan d&#8217.investissements dans les &#171. infrastructures &#187. de plusieurs milliards de dollars, qui a largement ̩t̩ consid̩r̩ comme une porte grande ouverte  laprivatisation des services publics, y compris les r̩seaux d&#8217.eau et d&#8217.assainissement.

Elles ne m̩nagent pas leur peine pour enrichir le leader fran̤ais de la grande distribution, comme t̩moigne l۪une d۪elles, ouvri̬re chez un fournisseur de Carrefour  et du g̩ant ̩tats-unien Walmart  au Bangladesh : &#171.Je me sens tellement malade et fatigu̩e apr̬s une journ̩e de travail que je ne veux pas travailler le lendemain. Mais la faim ne permet pas de penser  la maladie, la seule id̩e de vivre avec l۪estomac vide fait tout  oublier. Nous travaillons pour nous sauver de la faim.&#187.Salaire minimum ou salaire vitalDes t̩moignages comme ceux-ci, les enqu̻teurs de lacampagne Clean Clothes(v̻tements propres), en ont recueilli des centaines[1]. Ils ont constat̩ les conditions de travail dans trente usines textile d۪Asie qui fournissent des v̻tements pour cinq grandes enseignes de distribution : Carrefour (France), Walmart (tats-Unis), Tesco (Royaume-Uni), Aldi (Allemagne) ou Lidl (enseigne allemande de &#171. hard discount &#187. pr̩sente dans l۪Union europ̩enne). Depuisl۪effondrement d۪une usine fournissant Carrefouret la marque Zara au Bangladesh, en avril 2005 (tuant plus de 80 personnes), la situation n۪a gu̬re ̩volu̩ dans l۪eldorado textile des marques de pr̻t--porter.Le salaire d۪abord. Carrefour aura beau jeu de dire qu۪il respecte la l̩gislation locale. &#171.Chaque jour, le groupe Carrefour utilise ses comp̩tences, son ̩nergie et ses ressources afin de rester une entreprise hautement performante, socialement responsable et durable&#187., proclame son rapport 2007 sur le d̩veloppement durable. Au Bangladesh, o_ les salaires sont les plus bas, le &#171. Smic &#187. local est de 16,6 euros par mois[2]Carrefour ferait donc preuve d۪un progressisme social quasi r̩volutionnaire en payant des ouvri̬res jusqu۪au double du salaire minimum ! Soit entre 21 et 34 euros mensuels pour une semaine de 70 heures, voir de 90 heures pour les usines o_ le salaire est plus ̩lev̩ gr̢ce  l۪usage intensif des heures suppl̩mentaires.Droits syndicauxLes 25 millions de clients qui arpentent quotidiennement les rayons de la grande surface (dans le monde) doivent cependant connątre la diff̩rence entre &#171. salaire minimum &#187. et &#171. salaire vital &#187.. Le salaire vital, c۪est un revenu qui permet au travailleur et  sa famille &#171.de couvrir leurs besoins d۪aliments nutritifs et d۪eau potable, de logement, de v̻tements, d۪̩ducation, de soins de sant̩ et de transport, et qui leur permet ̩galement de r̩aliser quelques ̩conomies&#187., explique la campagne Clean Clothes. Le salaire vital au Bangladesh est estim̩ aux alentours de 50 euros par mois. Dans l۪Inde voisine, des associations de d̩fense des travailleurs de la confection l۪̩valuent  80 euros. Des salaires &#171. d̩cents &#187. que Carrefour - et ses 83 milliards d۪euros de chiffre d۪affaires (2007) - ne daigne m̻me pas accorder. Sans oublier la pr̩carit̩ de nombreux contrats. &#171.L۪immense majorit̩ des travailleurs sur les 31 lieux de travail de notre ̩tude gagnent au moins le salaire minimum l̩gal, et un grand nombre d۪entre eux gagnent plus. Mais aucun travailleur ne gagne un salaire vital, plongeant bon nombre d۪entre eux dans d۪̩normes difficult̩s. Cette situation refl̬te la mani̬re dont les enseignes de la grande distribution appliquent leurs codes de conduite, se concentrant uniquement sur les salaires minimaux l̩gaux alors que leurs codes de conduite avancent des engagements bien plus ambitieux&#187., pointe le rapport.&#171. Mai qu۪attendent ces emmerdeurs de syndicalistes pour revendiquer un salaire minimum vital ? &#187., r̩agirait un trader emprunt d۪une soudaine compassion tout en revendant  la hausse pour plusieurs millions d۪euros d۪actions Carrefour. En septembre 2008, c۪est ce qu۪on demand̩ plusieurs organisations syndicales, souhaitant qu۪il soit fix̩  45 euros.

Wages &#171. decent &#187. that Carrefour-and its 83 billion euros of turnover (2007)-not even deign to grant. Without forgetting the precariousness of many contracts. &#171. The vast majority of workers on the 31 workplace our study earn at least the legal minimum wage, and a large number of them earn more.

5979f36a819c9e61077752a7;R1715;neutre;A new law: tackling slavery in supply chainsRuth ChambersA wide coalition of civil society groups is today (26 March) celebrating the passing of a new law which will require businesses to tell the public what they are doing to eradicate slavery and forced labour from their supply chains.The law is part of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, which received Royal Assent today and which will also establish an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner and new rights for victims of modern slavery.Modern slavery is closer to home than you might think, with domestic businesses as diverse asnail bars,a bed factoryand apicture frame manufacturerall recently found or suspected to have been involved in human trafficking or forced labour. As if that wasn۪t shocking enough, there ismounting evidenceon human rights abuses in overseas supply chains, with the haunting images of theRana Plaza building collapseand child labour exploitation never far from our minds.The first step to tackling the heinous crime of slavery is transparency. As consumers we cannot take action unless we know who makes our clothes, who grows our food and who assembles our technology.The requirement on businesses to make their supply chains more transparent received cross-party support during its Parliamentary passage, although its initial absence from the bill was baffling and denied it vital discussion time and scrutiny in the House of Commons.Following pressure and evidence from many MPs and civil society groups,the government included the supply chains provision at Report in the House of Commons. Thanks to severalexcellent debatesin the House of Lords, the provision was strengthened and clarified. Many Peers championed the importance of the public being able to gain easy access to businesses۪ statements on slavery in their supply chains. Particular thanks are due toLord Altonfor his leadership and toBaroness Kennedy of Cradley,the Bishop of Derby,Baroness MobarikandBaroness Young of Hornseyfor their work to strengthen the new law.The campaign for greater transparency in supply chains was also supported by many prominent businesses such as Unilever and Ikea, as well as members of the Ethical Trading Initiative. Leading investors such as Hermes and the Alliance Trustpraised the law for giving certainty and clarity to businesses.Church Leaderswere also supportive, as was the Designate Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Kevin Hyland.Whilst the new law is definitely one to be celebrated, not all of the lessons from the implementation of similar legislation in California were learnt. Many felt that the reporting framework for businesses should have included minimum requirements rather than voluntary guidelines, and the absence of a central online repository for reports was a key omission, although we are told that the Home Office is working to address this.Aconsultationon this part of the bill runs until 7 May, and regulations will, in due course, be laid before Parliament to set the threshold above which businesses will be required to comply with the new law. Both these processes offer further opportunities to engage with government.This may be the first dedicated UK legislation to deal with modern slavery in general and slavery in supply chains in particular but given the scale and deep-seated nature of the problem it is unlikely to be the last. I think that we can take considerable heart from the wide backing that transparency in supply chains received and the knowledge that we will be able to draw on this both in taking the new law forward and in any future law-making processes.Ruth Chambers is an independent consultant and advisor who co-ordinated the Transparency in Supply Chains Coalition from October 2014 to March 2015.&larr.Modern Slavery Bill: information on supply chains must be easy to accessLabour Party Manifesto 2015: key points on corporate accountability&rarr.;

The gag was originated by the creative team at LifeHunters, who then approached both Ikea and the museum with the idea, LifeHunters' Erik Hensel tellsNL Times. In the end, it really was a cooperative effort between the three to make the video happen, Hensel points out.""We always think of ideas a week before we shoot,"" he adds. ""We thought about this one six weeks before.""LifeHunters used the time to embed a small hidden camera on the painting to capture authentic reactions from the amateur art connoisseurs, and to develop a script for Lange to advance the interactions with museum visitors.""Nothing was staged.

Rijkswaterstaat, the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, has closed the A13 exit toward Ikea Delft several times already to avoid accidents. The traffic on the exit tends to get completely backed up, as was the case again this past Sunday, despite attempts by Ikea to deploy traffic controllers. 'We will close down the exit if it gets too dangerous. There's nothing else we can do,' said Raymund Valkhof of Rijkswaterstaat. None of the parties involved can think of a fitting solution. 'The roadmap for traffic congestion has been adjusted and improved every time,' said alderman Mil̬ne Junius. This coming Sunday will have to prove whether taking the 1 euro breakfast off the Ikea menu is the solution to the traffic jams on the A13 exit.By agrobinson on January 24, 2014 - 04:36;

597a06cad848472c164d1c0f;R1889;HS;"CommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantAcross the country, Walmart۪s own workers are rising up to challenge the behemoth corporation for its poor working conditions and abysmal wages. As Danny Duncan Collum indicates inStanding Up to Goliath۝(January 2013),۝ the Walmart workforce is making history by organizing strikes against one of the largest employers in the world.During Black Friday, hundreds of Walmart workers walked off the job, risking arrest and loss of employment. Allies such as Stephanie Kimec, a US-2 missionary for the United Methodist Church, took part in the nationwide day of action. Here she shares her experience of standing in solidarity with the Walmart workers in Paramount, Calif.From the EditorsAs I reflect on my experience of being arrested at the Paramount Walmart on Black Friday, I find myself thinking of sacred space. What a sacred space to be into be surrounded by workers, activists, clergy, and supporters as I and eight others sat in the street to speak up against the ways Walmart treats its employees.When I was asked the week before if I would be willing to risk arrest with a few others, including Walmart workers, I responded that I would pray about it. As I did, I thought about when I first became aware of what kind of a corporation Walmart is. When I was in college I attended a screening of a documentary about Walmart. My older sister worked there for a little while. The whole time I watched the documentary I thought about her, about the discrimination she faced, and the poor wages she was given, along with little opportunity for advancement. It was then that I decided I would try to limit my purchases at Walmart as much as I could.I am saddened to say my biggest hang-up about being arrested involved concerns of how this would affect my ordination process. After consulting some trusted mentors, I decided it was worth the risk. I have been wrestling a lot this past year with my privilege as a white woman and the power that comes with that. I ultimately decided this was a good way to use my privilege to help shed light on a company which has committed many grievances against its employees, the very people who make Walmart run.I was willing to take part in this civil disobedience not because this was my way of saying I know what۪s best for you poor Walmart employees.۝ Rather, I wanted to affirm that Yes, I will stand with you as you also risk arrest, as you have decided this is what you want to do to tell Walmart this must stop.۝ What a sacred space to be invited to join with workers as they risk not only a misdemeanor, but losing their jobs and livelihood as well.What a sacred space to be in a holding cell with two Walmart employees as they shared their experiences. Both have looked for other jobs, but no one will hire them. Both of them had to spend Thanksgiving Day at work, as Walmart decided to stay open through the holiday. One cashier shared how she had to turn angry customers away who tried to buy special sale items before they could be sold. Because Walmart never closed on Thanksgiving Day and night, certain items went on special sales at certain times. She does not create the rules at Walmart, yet must enforce the retailer۪s policies. She was clearly exhausted and disappointed to not have the opportunity to spend the day with friends or family.Both women shared that they work with people who remember what it was like to work at Walmart just 15 to 20 years ago, when it was a place that valued its employees. All they want is for Walmart to return to a place where employees matter, earn fair wages, have opportunities to care for and support their families, can receive health benefits, and can work full-time. What a sacred space to be invited intoa space where workers can share their hopes and experiences as they risk so much to bring about real change to Walmart.I۪ve become more aware of what warehouse workers experience who are contracted to work for Walmart. They work in horrible conditions, receiving little with regards to wages, and threatened if they try to speak out. I was only in jail for a few hours, and it was nothing compared to what my brothers and sisters who work at Walmart endure every day to earn a living.The handcuffs and misdemeanor are worth it, as a means of telling Walmart to listen to its employees and begin treating them as human beings, people with rights. I pray that Walmart repents and turns back from its waysthat it may become a place that cares for its employees, shares its vast riches with the very people who have allowed it to become so wealthy, and becomes a place that fosters love instead of greed.View the discussion thread.I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them.

The Carrefour and Leclerc distributors announced, on Monday, November 5, that they would exceptionally distribute fuel at cost prices for a limited period. ""In a context of a drastic increase in fuel prices and faithful to its fight for the purchasing power of the French, the E. Leclerc Movement has taken the decision to extend its offer of fuel at cost, initially scheduled from November 2 to November 4, until November 30, 2018,"" the group said in a statement. "" The one who gets the growth is the consumer. Today this grogne is legitimate, ""President Michel-Edouard Leclerc said in the morning of France Info."" It is important commercially to satisfy our customers, but it is also important to give a signal to the public authorities. ""All our employees, our managers tell us: there is a ras-le-bol,"" said Michel-Edouard Leclerc.The operation, which was initially proposed during the last weekend of the All Saints holidays, was extended by the second oil operator in France in November at its 684 service stations. In the past, Leclerc has already carried out similar operations. Many Leclerc stations had a litre of unleaded 95 gasoline containing up to 10 percent ethanol (SP95-E10) under 1.45 euros on Monday, according to the government website.Carrefour also proposed a similar initiative between November 5 and 17, announced to consumers by advertising in newspapers. ""Carrefour inaugurates the Fuel Days, an unprecedented operation by its device and its scope"" in more than two hundred service stations integrated into the Carrefour hypermarkets, the company said in a statement, which also announced ""a series of measures to defend its customers' purses until the end of the year"".When asked by AFP, System U said that each of its operators was free ""locally"" to sell their fuel at cost or not, but that there was no ""national word"" on the subject. The margins of the major fuel distribution, seen as a ""call product,"" are still very low, ""in the order of 1 to 2 cents of euros per litre,"" a government spokesman said.The protests against rising fuel prices, including a petition signed by more than 700,000 people, recently crystallized around a call to block roads on November 17. In interviews published on Monday, Macron said he was taking on the tax increase, saying he was in favour of ""innovative"" solutions for people who had to move to work.Under the same heading PARIS 16 (75016) 2980000  245 m2 PARIS 11 (75011) 425000  42 m2 PARIS 11 (75011) 361900  31 m2 TOYOTA IQ 4500  61 HYUNDAI IX35 10890  24 OPEL MOKKA X 17500  40 Le Mondeutilise des cookies pour vous Offering une exp̩rience userid de qualit̩, measuring l' audience, optimisation les functionalities des r̩seaux sociaux et vous propose des advertisements personalized.

Every year, we sit at our seder tables and proclaim, We were slaves. . . and now we are free.۝ We see ourselves as part of the story of the pastbut it doesn۪t end there. The communal trauma of slavery becomes a commitment to justice and action. As we tell our children our history, we quote Exodus and say: It is because of what God did for me when I went free from Egypt.۝  (Exodus 13:8) But what is It۝? This includes our actions in the present day. Our deep consciousness both of the pain of bondage and the blessing of freedom must inspire Jews to combat slavery in the modern world.Part of this consciousness is understanding that modern-day slavery is not a remote problem perpetuated by someone else. Slavery is a symptom of bigger social problems like poverty, migration, and the low status of women and girls. If we do not address these root causes, big as they are, we may help individual people out of slavery, but we cannot actually prevent it. Slavery is the extreme end of a continuum of exploitation for the world۪s most vulnerable populations.Closer to home, one of the messages that many of us often hear is that there is slavery in the supply chains of the products that we buy every day: cotton, chocolate, produce. This can be paralyzing when we go to the mall or the grocery store. None of us want to purchase something that originates in an extreme human rights violation. But the solution cannot be simply to buy a different product. When we talk about labor trafficking, we must keep the focus on the worker who is enslaved rather than the product we consume.As a rabbi, I know that it is not my tomato or banana that is created in the image of Godit is the person who picked that product. Fighting for food justice means ensuring the human rights and wages of workers, and doing so in a way that places the needs, dignity, and expertise of the workers at the head of the table. This last piece is crucial: no one can tell us how best to solve human rights abuses in supply chains, including modern slavery, more than the workers who have the most at stake.This framingworker-led human rights solutionsis at the heart ofThe Rabbinic Call for Human Rights۪ (T۪ruah)campaign to end modern-day slavery. We are honored to serve as the Jewish ally of theCoalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Florida-based worker-rights organization that has transformed the Florida tomato industry from ground zero۝ for human trafficking in America to no cases of human trafficking in the past three years. Their work has been singled out bythe White Houseas one of the most successful and innovative programs۝ to actually prevent human trafficking. This is remarkable given the significant number of trafficking cases in agriculture in the U.S.Many of us may be familiar with the CIW۪s Campaign for Fair Food, in which major corporations are persuaded to pay one penny more per pound for Florida tomatoes (which goes directly to farmworkers) and only buy from growers who have committed to a binding human rights code of conduct in the fields (which includes a zero-tolerance policy for forced labor). To date, 13 corporationsincluding Walmart, McDonald۪s, and Whole Foodshave signed on.But many of us are not aware of the dramatic changes that have been happening among Florida farmworkers since late 2010, when the CIW۪s Fair Food Program began to be implemented in more than 90% of Florida۪s tomato fields. Today, for Florida tomato workers, a new world ofk۪vod habriot(human dignity) is being built, as human rights are written into the very fabric of an industry once known for punishing conditions. It is an unparalleled, worker-led system of accountability, transparency, and enforcement.T۪ruah has made our work with the CIW the heart of our antitrafficking commitment, because we believe it is important to do more than raise awareness about human trafficking. We must raise up the leadership of those most affected by forced labor and support their efforts to create new futures for themselves. Since 2011, T۪ruah has taken more than 50 rabbis to Immokalee to learn from the CIW. The stories they hearand the transformation they seeinspire them to go home and turn their congregations into more than just educated consumers. They become activists: they write letters to corporations urging them to join the Fair Food Program, stage protests, take Hebrew school students to meet with managers, write op-eds, and deliver sermons. Our #TomatoRabbis have become part of the larger movement of Fair Food activists, urging corporations to live up to their professed values and join the new day dawning in the Florida tomato industry that is the only proven slavery-prevention program in the U.S.In March 2013, a few weeks before Passover, I participated in CIW۪s March for Fair Food with my older daughter Liora. Early one morning, as dawn broke and we sat on a bus bearing a banner No more slavery in the fields,۝ she asked me to practice the Four Questions, which she would recite at the seder very soon. Listening to her chant in Hebrewmah nishtanah ha layla hazeh, why is this night different from all other nights, I understood the power of the commitment we make as Jews each year.We cannot tell the story of slavery without committing to action in the present day. And we are blessed to know that today real solutions are possible.Rabbi Rachel Kahn-Trosteris Director of Programs for T۪ruah and coordinates the #TomatoRabbis partnership with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. T۪ruah represents more than 1800 rabbis who use their moral voicesto act on the Jewish imperative to respect and advance the human rights of all people.View the discussion thread.I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them.

In tutti i casi,le concentrazioni rimangono al di sotto delle soglie fissate dalla normativama questo non ci deve far stare comunque tranquilli in quanto a questi residui potenzialmente tossici i neonati e i bambini sono esposti anche attraverso altri prodotti di consumo (giocattoli, prodotti per l'igiene, cibo).Sarebbe importante quindi evitare la presenza di questi residuipotenzialmente rischiosi all'interno dei pannolini, ci_ ̬ possibile dato che in due modelli non sono stati trovati residui tossici (vedi sotto).Tra l۪altro, come sottolinea anche la rivista, le dosi tollerate sono stabilite in base alla possibile inalazione della sostanza e non rispetto al contatto con la pelleche come sappiamo, nel caso dei bambini, ̬ particolarmente sensibile e delicata.Anche negli assorbenti femminili,a contatto con parti altrettanto delicate, si pu_ riscontrare lo  stesso problema.

597a05a3d848472c164d1b28;R1868;HS;"CommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantSALT LAKE CITY  Maybe now, reporters, bloggers, outsiders, and even many Mormons will accept that the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not forbid drinking cola.On Aug. 29, the LDS churchposted a statement on its websitesaying that the church does not prohibit the use of caffeine۝ and that the faith۪s health-code reference to hot drinks۝ does not go beyond (tea and coffee).۝A day later, the website wording was slightly softened, saying only that the church revelation spelling out health practices ... does not mention the use of caffeine.۝The same goes for the church۪s two-volume handbook, which LDS leaders use to guide their congregations. It says plainly that the only official interpretation of hot drinks۪ ... in the Word of Wisdom is the statement made by early church leaders that the term hot drinks۪ means tea and coffee.۝That doesn۪t mean church leaders view caffeinated drinks as healthy. They just don۪t bar members from, say, pounding a Pepsi, downing a Mountain Dew, or sipping a hot chocolate. Even GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has been seen drinking an occasional Diet Coke.This week۪s clarification on caffeine is long overdue,۝ said Matthew Jorgensen, a Mormon and longtime Mountain Dew drinker.Jorgensen, who is doing a two-year research fellowship in Germany, grew up in a devout Mormon household, in a small, devout Mormon town,۝ where his neighbors and church leaders viewed drinking a Coca-Cola as so close to drinking coffee that it made your worthiness ... questionable.۝That view was magnified when the late LDS church President Gordon B. Hinckley offhandedly told 60 Minutes۝ that Mormons avoid caffeine. Several earlier LDS leaders, including apostle Bruce R. McConkie, considered imbibing Coke as a violation of the spirit۝ of the Word of Wisdom.It was dictated in 1833 by Mormon founder Joseph Smith and bars consumption of wine, strong drinks (alcohol), tobacco and hot drinks,۝ which have been defined by church authorities as tea and coffee.Even so, many outsiders and plenty of insiders get that wrong.Journalists  fromThe New York Times۪ columnist Maureen Dowd toThe Associated Press have often stated that Mormons don۪t drink caffeine. Last week, NBC News۪hourlong feature on Mormonismmade the same mistake, prompting the church۪s initial statement on its website.That blog post was later tweaked, according to church spokesman Scott Trotter, to clarify its intent, which was to provide context to the NBC piece.۝Part of the confusion stems from LDS church-owned Brigham Young University, which neither sells nor serves caffeinated drinks. But BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins explains that is not a university or church decision, but made by dining services, based on what our customers want.۝There has not been a demand for it,۝ Jenkins said Thursday. We are constantly evaluating what those needs and desires are.۝Indeed, fully caffeinated colas are available in the church۪s Joseph Smith Memorial Building, and in the Lion House Pantry, next to the faith۪s headquarters in downtown Salt Lake City.In the end, it۪s up to individual Latter-day Saints to decide what to drink.I can understand why the church is cautious,۝ Jorgensen wrote in an email. Saying that caffeine is OK might sound like saying that caffeine is healthy, maybe even an endorsement of caffeine. Plus, I think members need opportunities to work through questions of right and wrong for themselves.۝Caffeine, he said, is the perfect, low-risk testing ground for members to make decisions for themselves.۝Peggy Fletcher Stackwrites forThe Salt Lake Tribune.ViaRNS.Photo: Empty soda cans,somchai rakin/ Shutterstock.comView the discussion thread.I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them.

59a62a9c81e8f45132b07770;R2011;Positif;As the biggest energy importer anywhere in the world, a strong push on energy efficiency in the EU makes sense. Since 2008 the EU has slowly but steadily been working to improve its energy efficiency. It now holds the record as the most efficient bloc in the world. This means although the EU economy has expanded by around a third since 1990, energy usage has been stabilised across the bloc at the same levels used back then. This is remarkable &ndash. especially so given the burgeoning numbers of new gadgets and devices we increasingly rely upon for everyday life.Yet despite the well documented GDP and energy security gains and system cost reductions that would come from a strong push on energy efficiency, there is a risk that the 2030 energy efficiency target agreed by the European Council on 23/24 October will be set at 30% and be indicative only.A target set this low will mean that Europe will go no slower &ndash. but also no faster &ndash. than it is currently on energy efficiency.The negative implications of this for European security, prosperity and competitiveness cannot be underestimated.  This is something big businesses such as IKEA, Philips and Unilever get &ndash. but that some Governments, notably the UK, seem to have yet to realise.Despite good progress on energy efficiency in some countries and sectors, progress overall has been patchy. Germany has been identified as the most efficient economy in the world. But in terms of recent progress, the biggest energy savings made during 2008-2012 were by Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Hungary and Slovakia. In contrast, progress on energy efficiency declined in Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Poland during the same period. Similarly in areas where mandatory European-led regulation has been introduced, there has been a significant impact on reducing energy use in Europe. For example the CO in Cars Regulation has been a key driver of rising transport efficiency standards &ndash. with vehicle efficiency improving 28% since 1995. In buildings, regulations on energy use in new buildings requiring house builders to fit insulation, superefficient windows etc, mean new homes consume 40% less energy compared to 20 years ago. Energy efficiency in appliances has also picked up markedly in recent years, driven by more stringent products standards and labelling. Rising energy prices have driven efficiency gains in industry - but the picture is mixed, with significant opportunities to further reduce energy use, especially in central and eastern European countries, left untapped. All this argues for a stronger not weaker push on efficiency to 2030 &ndash. a binding target being the obvious next step.This would also have a strong social benefit. There are now 56m Europeans unable to keep their homes warm.Many of these people live in the central and eastern Member States that are most exposed to the Russian energy security threat and at the same time have the worst record on implementing the national legislation required under the Energy Efficiency Directive. Some governments, instead of asking for help to improve the energy efficiency of their economies, have focused on demanding support for new gas infrastructure and carve outs for new coal. Putting aside for a moment the adverse impact on GHG emissions, these types of investments will deliver a poor impact in terms of energy security gains or public investment to create local jobs compared to the alternative of investing in more efficient energy use.Introducing a binding EU 2030 energy efficiency target within the package would provide some compulsion to these Member States to turn the Energy Efficiency Directive into national laws that would unlock public and private investment opportunities to remedy this situation &ndash. making homes warm, industry competitive and putting them on the pathway to least cost decarbonisation. The &lsquo.public&rsquo. part of the financing question could be answered through ring-fencing some of the west-to-east financial transfers undertaken through the Modernisation Fund that is expected to be part of the final 2030 deal and programmed into forthcoming EU Budget. This of course could still happen but will look less likely without some degree of mandation in the 2030 package.So what next for the energy efficiency agenda? Certainly the lack of a binding target, if it comes to pass, will be a blow &ndash. but of course targets are not the be all and end all. There will be opportunities under the new Energy Union to create a space for the equal treatment of demand side and supply side markets that can promote energy efficiency investment. Similarly in the Capital Market Union there needs to be a focus on ensuring the financial reforms governing capital market investment in infrastructure promote and don&rsquo.t penalise investment in efficiency. The 2030 governance discussion creates a space in which to deliver the institutional and economic reforms needed to address some of the more onerous market barriers and transaction costs. Finally, tightened and properly implemented market-based regulation can continue to see energy efficiency ramped up both in product manufacturing and building refurbishments.There is still everything to play for. But in terms of ensuring the low carbon transition is done at least cost and in a way that is fair to regular citizens not just big business, without binding energy efficiency targets the job will be a lot harder.A target set this low will mean that Europe will go no slower &ndash. but also no faster &ndash. than it is currently on energy efficiency.;

The rays coloured propose really hundreds of yoghurt, chocolates, dishes prepared ... different? No, according to a study by the American NGO Food and Water Watch.To achieve its study (t̩l̩chargerici), Food &amp. Water Watch studied 100 categories of products present in the American supermarket. And its conclusions are part myth consumer choice. Behind the appearance of rays filled with diverse products, mass merchandisers offer food placed on the market by only a handful of giants agri-food. For a third of the types of products examined, four or less companies control more than 75% of market share.Take the example of food for baby: three major companies control 90% of sales! On the cereals sector breakfast, four companies (Kellogg&# 8217. s, General Mills, PepsiCo and Post Foods) focus 80% of market share, under dozens of different brands. Similarly, 86% of sales of beer are performed in the United States by four companies. You have the choice between a pack of Stella, Leffe or Budweiser. But all these brands belong to the same enterprise: AB InBev (which holds 47% of market shares of beer in Atlantic).The concentration very thrust of the agri-food is not visible in supermarket shelves. The client feel the choice between different producers. The pratique&#171. leaves consumers believe that choose between competing products while simply choose between products manufactured by the same company, and perhaps even in the same plant &#187., concludes the study Food &amp. Water Watch.The situation is comparable in France? The concentration of food distribution between the hands of a few groups is all similar cases. In the United States, more than half of the money spent by consumers in their food races went to relatives of four companies supermarkets in 2012, note the NGOs in his study [ 1 ]. In France, a handful of groups large distribution (Leclerc, Carrefour, Auchan ...) are also the majority of market share food. And several giants agri-food ubiquitous in supermarket shelves in the US are far from unknown in France. Nestl̩ (72% of market shares of food for infants in the United States, 47% of sales of frozen pizzas, 47% of animal feed) distributes in France a dozen brands of breakfast cereal (Chocapic, Nestle Crunch, ..) seven brands of mineral water (Vittel, Perrier, Perrier, ...) several brands of cocoa powder. Unilever sells in France dozens of brands of condiments, soups, ice. Danone meets eight brands of yogurt and three names very known bottled water: Volvic, Evian, Badoit.To avoid having by this illusion of choice, the NGO United States gives some advice self-defence consumer lost in a supermarket: do not venture in the middle of the store, s&#8217. attention to products placed at the top or at the bottom of the shelves, make a list of purchase and stick to it ...

Molte delle bibite testate dagli esperticontengono tracce di alcol,pari circa a10 milligrammi per litro: una quantit minima, che diventa per_ potenzialmente dannosa nel momento in cui aumenta la quantit di cola bevuta. Un dato che solleva allarme soprattutto tra quelle popolazioni in cui l'alcol ̬ bandido dalla dieta per motivi religiosi.Nella lista delle marche incriminate troviamo di tutto: la Coca-Cola nella versione classica, Light e anche la Zero, Pepsi Cola classica e Max, Leclerc classica e quella con Stevia, Dia, Breizh Cola, la Cola del Carrefour nella versione classica e leggera, quella Auchan, fino ad arrivare ai marchi famosi soprattutto all'estero, come Cora, Casino, Leader Price, U-Man Cola.Ma la peggiore  per la quantit di alcool rinvenuta  ̬ laSoda Strema, che arriva addirittura a 272 ml di alcool per litro.Ma quale sar stata la reazione dei responsabili di queste grandi aziende produttrici di Coca alcolica?Michel P̩pin, direttore scientifico della Coca Cola, ha ammesso che durante il processo di produzione ci possono essere tracce di alcol. Come si pu_leggere sul sito inglese della multinazionale,infatti,""Tracce di alcol possono verificarsi naturalmente in molti cibi e bevande.

La petite organisation qui veut &#171. verdir &#187. les multinationales les plus mal fam̩esResponsabilit̩Au cours de l&#8217.ann̩e 2013, plusieurs grandes multinationales qui constituaient des cibles traditionnelles des ONG, comme Coca-Cola, le g̩ant de l&#8217.huile de palme Wilmar ou le forestier APP, ont annonc̩ en fanfare qu&#8217.elles se convertissaient  des politiques d&#8217.approvisionnement responsable. Pour Yale Environment 360, le journaliste Fred Pearce dresse le profil de The Forest Trust (TFT), une petite firme de consultance qui aide ces grands groupes mal fam̩s  rendre leurs pratiques plus durables - et qui ne parąt pas (encore ?) totalement discr̩dit̩e dans les milieux ̩cologistes. Greenwashing ou changements concrets ?Cet article a ̩t̩ publi̩ initialement en anglais parYale Environment 360, tous droits r̩serv̩s. Publi̩ avec permission. Traduction : Olivier Petitjean.Pour quiconque s&#8217.int̩resse au comportement des grandes entreprises mondiales, 2013 aura ̩t̩ une ann̩e extraordinaire. Sous la pression des ONG, une flop̩e de firmes multinationales, leaders mondiaux dans leurs industries respectives, ont pris des engagements sans pr̩c̩dents d&#8217.am̩lioration de leurs pratiques environnementales et sociales. Il y a au moins une chance que leurs promesses ne soient pas du &#171.greenwashing&#187. et que, comme le dit une personne impliqu̩e, &#171.on puisse leur maintenir le couteau sous la gorge, pour une fois&#187..Cette personne est Scott Poynton, fondateur et directeur d&#8217.une organisation environnementale dont vous n&#8217.avez probablement jamais entendu parler, The Forest Trust (TFT). Si quelqu&#8217.un d̩tient la cl̩ de la question de savoir s&#8217.il s&#8217.agit d&#8217.un v̩ritable tournant pour la durabilit̩ ou d&#8217.un nouveau coup de propagande dubig business, c&#8217.est Poynton. En ce moment m̻me, dans la foul̩e des annonces des grandes entreprises, c&#8217.est Poynton qui a la capacit̩ de leur garder le couteau sous la gorge.En novembre, l&#8217.une des principales marques globales - avec une solide r̩putation de poursuivre ses propres int̩r̻ts commerciaux sans ̩tats d&#8217.̢me - a annonc̩ qu&#8217.elle souhaitait rejoindre les rangs des &#171. gentils &#187.. Coca-Cola, le plus important acheteur de sucre au niveau mondial, a d̩clar̩ qu&#8217.elle cesserait de s&#8217.approvisionner aupr̬s des fournisseurs qui n&#8217.adh̩reraient pas  ses nouvelles lignes directrices sur la protection des droits fonciers. Ces lignes directrices stipulent une &#171. tol̩rance z̩ro pour l&#8217.accaparement des terres &#187. et le respect des droits fonciers coutumiers des groupes et communaut̩s traditionnels.Cet engagement a ̩t̩ pris aupr̬s d&#8217.Oxfam, l&#8217.ONG internationale d&#8217.aide et de d̩veloppement d&#8217.origine britannique, qui avait lanc̩ une campagne contre l&#8217.accaparement des terres des firmes sucri̬res et d&#8217.autres acteurs. Pour d̩montrer son s̩rieux, Coca-Cola a promis de publier des ̩valuations ind̩pendantes de l&#8217.impact social, environnemental et sur les droits humains de ses activit̩s et de celles de ses fournisseurs. Un cadre d&#8217.Oxfam m&#8217.a d̩clar̩ : &#171.Nous ̩tions stup̩faits. Ils ont ̩t̩ au-del de ce que nous demandions.&#187.Quelques mois auparavant, la firme Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), le principal producteur mondial de produits  base de papier, bas̩  Jakarta, a fait une annonce similaire - avec potentiellement des implications majeures pour les for̻ts d&#8217.Asie du Sud-est. L&#8217.entreprise, qui exploite les for̻ts primaires d&#8217.Indon̩sie pour alimenter ses usines g̩antes, ̩tait depuis longtemps la cible des militants. Mais en f̩vrier dernier, elle a promis de cesser imm̩diatement toute coupe de for̻ts naturelles aussi bien de son propre fait que par ses filiales et ses fournisseurs. L&#8217.entreprise a dit qu&#8217.elle s&#8217.approvisionnerait d̩sormais dans des plantations et que &#171.l o_ de nouvelles plantations seraient projet̩es, APP respectera les droits des peuples indig̬nes et des communaut̩s locales, y compris les droits fonciers coutumiers&#187.. Les promesses d&#8217.APP, dont la mise en oeuvre sera contr̫l̩e par TFT, ont paru suffisantes  Greenpeace. L&#8217.ONG a suspendu sa campagne internationale contre l&#8217.entreprise, qu&#8217.elle accusait de &#171.r̩duire en pulpe la plan̬te&#187..Mais l&#8217.engagement dont la port̩e sera peut-̻tre la plus consid̩rable en derni̬re instance est intervenu en d̩cembre. Le principal n̩gociant mondial d&#8217.huile de palme, Wilmar, bas̩  Singapour, s&#8217.est engag̩  faire en sorte qu&#8217.aucun de ses fournisseurs ne soit plus impliqu̩ dans la d̩forestation ni la destruction de tourbi̬res. L aussi, TFT participera  la supervision de l&#8217.entreprise, afin de s&#8217.assurer que ces promesses seront tenues. D̬s lors que les fournisseurs de Wilmar, comme le souligne Poynton, repr̩sentent 80% de l&#8217.huile de palme mondiale, cette initiative peut changer radicalement la donne dans une industrie qui est probablement la principale cause de d̩forestation en Asie du Sud-est.L&#8217.engagement de Wilmar n&#8217.est pas tomb̩ du ciel. Il est la cons̩quence des efforts et des campagnes des ONG pour rendre plus propre la chąne d&#8217.approvisionnement d&#8217.un ingr̩dient que l&#8217.on retrouve dans un tiers des aliments transform̩s. Et il a suivi de pr̬s l&#8217.annonce, le mois pr̩c̩dent, du g̩ant de l&#8217.agroalimentaire Unilever, qui est le principal client de Wilmar et le principal acheteur mondial d&#8217.huile de palme. Unilever a promis que d&#8217.ici la fin 2014, elle aurait rendu enti̬rement tra̤able sa chąne d&#8217.approvisionnement, pour s&#8217.assurer que sa promesse de ne plus contribuer  la d̩forestation serait tenue. On peut dire que Wilmar n&#8217.avait pas vraiment le choix.Quoi qu&#8217.il en soit, la situation devient int̩ressante. Les entreprises et les investisseurs les plus importants au monde commencent  mettre  profit leur position de leaders sur leur march̩ pour pousser les standards vers le haut, plut̫t que vers le bas. Depuis la distribution et en remontant la chąne, ils exigent de leurs fournisseurs qu&#8217.ils mettent de l&#8217.ordre dans les pratiques. Peut-il en r̩sulter une &#171. course vers le haut &#187. ?Tout le monde n&#8217.est pas convaincu. Les beaux discours sont faciles, et d&#8217.autres leaders mondiaux ont d̩j fait des promesses similaires par le pass̩. En 2012, le g̩ant minier Rio Tinto a d̩clar̩ qu&#8217.il solliciterait d̩sormais le &#171. consentement pr̩alable libre et inform̩ &#187. des communaut̩s locales avant se lancer dans de nouveaux m̩gaprojets miniers. Mais il s&#8217.est av̩r̩ que les gouvernements nationaux, d̩sireux d&#8217.exploiter leurs ressources, ont permis  Rio Tinto de contourner cet engagement.L&#8217.ONG Human Rights Watch affirme que Rio Tinto participe encore au d̩racinement de communaut̩s paysannes pour faire la place  des mines de charbon au Mozambique. Et les promesses de Rio Tinto n&#8217.ont certainement pas emp̻ch̩ des militants du monde entier de se rendre  son Assembl̩e g̩n̩rale annuelle  Londres en avril dernier pour d̩noncer la mani̬re dont leurs terres et leurs points de vue sont pi̩tin̩s.Quelqu&#8217.un doit donc s&#8217.assurer que les destructeurs de for̻ts vierges et les accapareurs de terre repentants sont  la hauteur de leurs promesses. Pour le moment, le mieux plac̩ pour ̻tre ce &#171. quelqu&#8217.un &#187. est Poynton, un Australien bravache, ancien forestier, qui a fond̩ TFT en 1999. Cette organisation  but non lucratif, avec des bureaux en Suisse et en Grande-Bretagne, a ̩t̩ mandat̩e par Wilmar, APP, le g̩ant de l&#8217.agroalimentaire Nestl̩, et une ribambelle d&#8217.autres entreprises pour s&#8217.assurer qu&#8217.elles tiennent leur parole. Il dit qu&#8217.il serait ravi de recevoir un coup de t̩l̩phone de Coca-Cola. Et loin d&#8217.̻tre consid̩r̩ comme un agent degreenwashing, pour l&#8217.instant du moins, il b̩n̩ficie de la confiance de quelques-uns des activistes environnementalistes et sociaux les plus virulents  l&#8217.heure actuelle.Dans le milieu des ONG, on dit souvent que Greenpeace et le TFT ont une sorte de complicit̩ informelle dans le cadre de laquelle elles se partagent le r̫le du &#171. bon flic &#187. et du &#171. mauvais flic &#187..  Lorsque les entreprises dont la r̩putation a ̩t̩ mise en pi̬ces par Greenpeace crient merci, lesrainbow warriorsleur conseillent d&#8217.aller discuter avec Poynton.Que cela soit vrai ou non, Nestl̩ s&#8217.est tourn̩e vers TFT apr̬s que sa barre chocolat̩e Kit-Kat, qui contient de l&#8217.huile de palme des for̻ts indon̩siennes, ait subi les foudres de Greenpeace. En 2010, l&#8217.ONG a diffus̩ une publicit̩ d̩vastatrice contre la firme, dans laquelle un morceau de la barre chocolat̩e se transformait en un doigt ensanglant̩ d&#8217.orang-outang. Huit semaines apr̬s, Nestl̩ annon̤ait un accord avec TFT.Que fait donc au juste TFT ?C&#8217.est une firme de consultance  but non lucratif pas comme les autres. Son site web propose aux entreprises un &#171.partenariat en mati̬re de responsabilit̩ sur la chąne d&#8217.approvisionnement&#187.. Avec certaines firmes, il ne s&#8217.agissait que d&#8217.une mission de consultance conventionnelle, par exemple pour les aider  respecter les standards de certifications vertes comme leForest Stewardship Council(FSC) ou la Table-ronde sur l&#8217.huile de palme durable. Par exemple, TFT travaille depuis 2004 en RDC avec la firme foresti̬re tr̬s controvers̩e Congolaise Industrielle des Bois pour l&#8217.aider  respecter les r̬gles du FSC.Mais, r̩cemment, certaines entreprises ont commenc̩  afficher des objectifs plus ambitieux. Outre ses engagements environnementaux, Wilmar a accept̩, avec l&#8217.aide de TFT, d&#8217.adopter une politique d&#8217.&#171. exploitation z̩ro &#187. de sa force de travail et de consentement pr̩alable libre et inform̩ en mati̬re d&#8217.utilisation des terres.&#171.Nous ne sommes pas des auditeurs&#187., explique Poynton. &#171.Nous ne disons pas non plus aux entreprises ce qu&#8217.elles doivent faire. Nous les aidons  d̩velopper des r̩ponses aux enjeux qui les int̩ressent. Nous les aidons  inventer des politiques dont elles soient satisfaites, et ensuite nous allons sur le terrain avec eux pour construire leur capacit̩ de mettre en oeuvre ces politiques.&#187. Avec APP, explique-t-il, il aura fallu douze mois rien que pour concevoir la politique.Poynton insiste sur le fait qu&#8217.il n&#8217.est pas l pour jouer un r̫le de faire-valoir. &#171.Nous sommes p̩nibles, aga̤ants, et stricts. S&#8217.il y a des probl̬mes, nous d̩non̤ons l&#8217.accord. C&#8217.est ce que nous faisons lorsque des entreprises ne sont pas s̩rieuses et ouvertes avec nous - lorsque nous apprenons sans cesse de nouvelles choses par les m̩dias, par exemple.&#187. Il souligne que TFT a mis fin  ses discussions avec un ̩tablissement financier d&#8217.envergure mondiale (qu&#8217.il n&#8217.a pas souhait̩ nommer), parce que celui-ci ne voulait pas r̩v̩ler la liste de ses clients.Mais Poyton se d̩clare pr̻t  rester aux c̫t̩s de firmes  la r̩putation sulfureuse, s&#8217.il pense que leurs efforts sont sinc̬res. Il donne en exemple une entreprise publique indon̩sienne qui exploite des for̻ts de teck sur l&#8217.̨le de Java, Perum Perhutani. TFT a pass̩ six ans  essayer de concevoir un projet pour cette entreprise. Il ̩tait r̩mun̩r̩ par des distributeurs europ̩ens et nord-am̩ricains qui vendent des meubles fabriqu̩s avec le bois de Perhutani. Dans le m̻me temps, des employ̩s de la compagnie tiraient sur les villageois qui p̩n̩traient ill̩galement dans ses for̻ts pour couper des arbres.&#171.De nombreux militants ont dit que nous ne devrions pas travailler avec Perhutani&#187., dit-il. &#171.Mais lorsque nous avons obtenu un accord en 2009, les fusils ont disparu de la for̻t tr̬s rapidement. Personne n&#8217.a ̩t̩ tu̩ depuis. On a tenu bon, et j&#8217.en suis fier.&#187.Y a-t-il un risque que TFT devienne un jour une firme de consultance comme les autres, plus int̩ress̩e  prot̩ger l&#8217.image des entreprises et  s&#8217.assurer des nouveaux clients que de leur tenir le couteau sous la gorge ? Poynton dit que cela n&#8217.arrivera jamais. &#171.Aucune chance. Bien sr, la fronti̬re est parfois ̩troite entre greenwashing et changement r̩el. Nous l&#8217.acceptons. Souvent, nous devons nous fier  notre instinct pour savoir si nous devons ou non continuer  travailler avec une entreprise. &#187.Aucun des militants d&#8217.ONG auxquels j&#8217.ai parl̩ ne conteste la sinc̩rit̩ de Poynton. Il n&#8217.en reste pas moins que cela donne beaucoup de pouvoir  une seule organisation - et  un seul individu. Et j&#8217.ai entendu des murmures de m̩contentements parmi les ONG qui se vouent  la protection des for̻ts et des droits des gens qui y vivent, et en vivent. Elfian Effendi, de l&#8217.organisation Greenomics Indonesia, dit que TFT &#171.promeut la violation des lois relatives  l&#8217.exploitation des for̻ts&#187. en donnant feu vert  son partenaire Golden Agri Resources pour poursuivre le d̩frichement de for̻ts sur de vastes concessions d&#8217.huile de palme dans la province du Kalimantan central - lesquelles sont en m̻me temps, de mani̬re d̩boussolante, classifi̩es par le gouvernement indon̩sien comme des for̻ts.Ils rechignent  se fier  l&#8217.instinct de Poynton sur la confiance  accorder aux entreprises. Ils aimeraient en savoir plus sur les accords qu&#8217.il passe avec les firmes, si possible en rendant les contrats publics en ligne. Et ils aimeraient des informations d̩taill̩es sur les chąnes d&#8217.approvisionnement, afin qu&#8217.ils puissent s&#8217.assurer eux-m̻mes de la v̩racit̩ des pr̩tentions des entreprises. Et l o_ TFT conseille des firmes sur les moyens de mettre fin  des conditions de travail exploitatrices ou d&#8217.obtenir le consentement des communaut̩s locales  des transactions fonci̬res, ils pensent que les communaut̩s devraient elles aussi participer au processus.Certains critiques soulignent que les promesses environnementales peuvent entrer en conflit avec les promesses sociales. La nouvelle politique de protection de la for̻t d̩velopp̩e par le g̩ant de l&#8217.huile de palme Golden Agri Resources, avec l&#8217.aide de TFT et le soutien de Greenpeace, risque fort de tomber dans ce travers. Marcus Colchester, de l&#8217.organisation britannique Forest Peoples&#8217. Programme, affirme que l&#8217.application de cette politique dans les for̻ts du centre de Born̩o a conduit  une interdiction de la p̻che et d&#8217.autres activit̩s traditionnelles des communaut̩s locales qui revendiquent elles aussi un droit sur ces for̻ts. Qui parlera pour elles ?Poynton est sensible  ces critiques. &#171.Je ne vais pas r̩v̩ler la teneur de mes contrats, mais je suis pr̻t  discuter avec les ONG&#187., dit-il. Il pense que certain de ses critiques ont choisi la facilit̩ en condamnant le monde de l&#8217.entreprise plut̫t que s&#8217.y confronter. Et il est convaincu que sa propre approche vaut la peine d&#8217.̻tre suivie. L&#8217.enjeu, selon lui, va bien au-del des relations publiques - il s&#8217.agit de changer la nature m̻me des entreprises.Certains dirigeants d&#8217.entreprise le comprennent. Ils se rendent compte qu&#8217.afin de prosp̩rer  long terme, ils ont besoin de chąnes d&#8217.approvisionnement durables pour leurs mati̬res premi̬res, et de marques  l&#8217.abri des risques r̩putationnels. Unilever, la principale firme mondiale de l&#8217.agroalimentaire et des produits d&#8217.hygi̬ne, s&#8217.est engag̩e  r̩duire par deux son impact environnemental d&#8217.ici 2020. Son patron Paul Polman d̩clarait l&#8217.ann̩e derni̬re : &#171.Si une entreprise veut s&#8217.assurer de sa long̩vit̩, la meilleure garantie est d&#8217.̻tre utile  la soci̩t̩. Ces principes ont ̩t̩ oubli̩s ces derni̬res ann̩es, et nous voulons les remettre au got du jour - pour le plus grand bien de tous. &#187.Mais si les grandes marques avec des r̩putations  perdre peuvent ̻tre mall̩ables, qu&#8217.en est-il des autres ? Les optimistes esp̬rent que les leaders mondiaux peuvent jouer un r̫le de pionnier et entrąner les autres dans leur sillage. Les pessimistes craignent que les autres ne consid̬rent les pr̩tentions ̩thiques de leurs concurrents comme un signe de faiblesse, et s&#8217.empressent d&#8217.en tirer profit. Il y a donc un enjeu consid̩rable  ce que le rival traditionnel de Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, suive le mouvement,  ce que l&#8217.autre g̩ant asiatique de l&#8217.huile de palme Olam fasse cause commune avec Wilmar, et  ce qu&#8217.APP soit rejointe par sa rival Asia Pacific Resources.S&#8217.agit-il vraiment d&#8217.un tournant - d&#8217.un moment o_ la &#171. course au moins-disant &#187. en mati̬re d&#8217.̩thique commerciale se transforme en course au mieux-disant ? Nous le saurons bient̫t.Fred Pearce&mdash.Photo :Rainforest Action Network CC;Coca-Cola, Nestl̩, Wilmar, APA ... The small organization that wants to &#171. green &#187. multinationals the most poorly in every backstreet Responsibility During l&#8217. year 2013, several large multinationals that constituted traditional targets NGOs, such as Coca-Cola, the giant l&#8217. palm oil Wilmar or forest APP, announced in fanfare for converting all qu&#8217 policies d&#8217. supply responsible. For Yale Environment 360, the journalist Fred Pearce lists the profile of The Forest Trust (TFT), a small consultancy firm that helps these major groups repute to make their practices more sustainable-and that is not (yet?) Totally discredited in the environmental community. Greenwashing or concrete changes?This article was published originally in English parYale Environment 360, all rights reserved. Published with permission. Translation: Olivier Petitjean.For anyone s&#8217. interested in the behavior of large global companies, 2013 was a special year. Under pressure from NGOs, a bunch of multinational firms, world leaders in their respective industries, have taken commitments without previous d&#8217. improving their environmental and social practices. There are at least a chance that their promises are not &#171. greenwashing&#187. and that, as said a person involved, &#171. we can maintain the knife to her throat, for a fois&#187..This person is Scott Poynton, founder and director d&#8217. an environmental organization that you n&#8217. have probably never heard, The Forest Trust (TFT). If quelqu&#8217. a holds the key to the question of s&#8217. it s&#8217. d&#8217. a real turning point for the sustainability or d&#8217. a new propaganda coup dubig business, c&#8217. Poynton. In this very moment, in the wake of announcements of big business, c&#8217. Poynton who has the capacity to keep the knife to her throat.In November, l&#8217. one of the major global brands-with a solid reputation for its own commercial interests continue without states d&#8217. soul-announced qu&#8217 and wanted to join the ranks of &#171. nice &#187.. Coca-Cola, the largest buyer of sugar worldwide, said qu&#8217 would s&#8217. and supply from suppliers who n&#8217. not accede to its new guidelines on the protection of land rights. These guidelines stipulate a &#171. zero tolerance for l&#8217. land grabbing &#187. and respect for customary land rights groups and traditional communities.This commitment was made to d&#8217. Oxfam, l&#8217. international NGO d&#8217. aid and development d&#8217. British origin, which had launched a campaign against l&#8217. land grabbing sugar firms and d&#8217. other actors. To demonstrate its seriousness, Coca-Cola has promised to publish independent evaluations of l&#8217. impact social, environmental and human rights of its activities and those of its suppliers. A framework d&#8217. m&#8217. Oxfam said: &#171. We were stunned. They were beyond what we asked. &#187. A few months earlier, the company Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), the main producer products paper, based in Jakarta, made a similar announcement-with potentially major implications for forest d&#8217. South Asia. L &#8217 company, which operates the primary forests d&#8217. Indonesia to feed its giant plants, long the target was militants. But last February, she promised to cease immediately any cutting natural forests of both its own fact that by its subsidiaries and its suppliers. L &#8217 company said qu&#8217 and s&#8217. would now in plantations and &#171. where new plantations would be projected, APA will respect the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, including land rights coutumiers&#187.. The promises d&#8217. APA, the implementation will be controlled by TFT, seemed sufficient to Greenpeace. L &#8217. NGOs has suspended its international campaign against l&#8217 company, qu&#8217 and accused &#171. reduce pulp plan̬te&#187..But l&#8217 .engagement scope may be the most significant last instance is reached in December. The main dealer global d&#8217. palm oil, Wilmar, based in Singapore, s&#8217 is committed to ensure qu&#8217. none of its suppliers is no longer involved in the deforestation or the destruction of peatlands. Again, TFT will participate in the supervision of l&#8217 company, so s&#8217. ensure that these promises will be held. Once the suppliers of Wilmar, Poynton said, represent 80% of l&#8217. palm oil world, this initiative can radically change the gives in an industry that is probably the main cause of deforestation in Southeast Asia.L &#8217 .engagement Wilmar n&#8217 is not fallen from the sky. It is the result of efforts and campaigns NGOs to make own string d&#8217. Supply d&#8217. an ingredient that l&#8217. found in a third of processed foods. And he closely followed l&#8217. announcement, the previous month, giant l&#8217. agri-food Unilever, which is the main client of Wilmar and the main buyer global d&#8217. palm oil. Unilever has promised that d&#8217. by the end of 2014, it would have made fully traceable chain d&#8217. supply, for s&#8217. ensure that its promise not to contribute to deforestation would be held. We can say that Wilmar n&#8217. had not really the choice.What qu&#8217., the situation becomes interesting. Businesses and investors the most important in the world begin to take advantage of their position on their market leaders to push standards up, rather than down. Since the distribution and up the chain, they require their suppliers qu&#8217. they l&#8217. order in practices. Can he be a &#171. race to the top &#187.?Everyone is not convinced. N&#8217 The speeches are easy, and d&#8217. other world leaders have already made similar promises in the past. In 2012, the mining giant Rio Tinto has said qu&#8217. it would now &#171. prior consent free and informed &#187. local communities before embarking on new mining megaprojects. But s&#8217 is to national governments, eager d&#8217 .exploiter their resources, allowed Rio Tinto to circumvent this commitment.L &#8217. NGO Human Rights Watch said that Rio Tinto is still uprooting of peasant communities to make way to coal mines in Mozambique. And the promises of Rio Tinto n&#8217. certainly have not prevented activists from around the world to go to General Assembly annual London in April to protest how their land and their views are being trampled.Quelqu&# 8217. a must therefore s&#8217. ensure that the destructive virgin forest and land grabbers do meet their promises. For the moment, the best placed to be this &#171. quelqu&#8217. a &#187. is Poynton, an Australian student, former forest, who founded TFT in 1999. This non-profit organization, with offices in Switzerland and Great Britain, was mandated by Wilmar, APA, the giant l&#8217. agri-food Nestl̩, and a throng d&#8217. other companies for s&#8217. ensure all qu&#8217 take their word. He said qu&#8217. it would be delighted to receive a phone call from Coca-Cola. And far d&#8217. be considered an agent degreenwashing, for l&#8217. now at least, he has the confidence of some of the environmentalists and social activists virulent to l&#8217. current time.In the middle of NGOs, often said that Greenpeace and the TFT have a kind of informal complicity through which they share the role of &#171. good cop &#187. and &#171. bad cop &#187..  When companies whose reputation has been implemented by Greenpeace screaming parts, thank lesrainbow warriorsleur advice d&#8217. go talk to Poynton.Whether this is true or not, Nestl̩ is forward-looking TFT s&#8217 after his chocolate bar Kit-Kat, which contains l&#8217. palm oil from Indonesian forests, has suffered the wrath of Greenpeace. In 2010, l&#8217. NGOs issued a devastating publicity against the firm, in which a piece of the chocolate bar is transformed into a bloodied finger d&#8217. orangutan. Eight weeks later, Nestl̩ announced a deal with TFT.What is the right TFT?C &#8217 is a consultancy firm non-profit not to. His website provides businesses a &#171. partnership liability on the string d&#8217. approvisionnement&#187.. With some firms, it s&#8217. it d&#8217. a mission of conventional consultancy, for example to help meet the standards of green certifications such as leForest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Round Table on l&#8217. palm oil sustainable. For example, TFT works since 2004 in Congo with the very controversial forestry firm Congolese Industrial Wood for l&#8217. help comply with the rules of FSC.But, recently, some companies have begun to display more ambitious goals. In addition to its environmental commitments, Wilmar has accepted, with l&#8217. using TFT, d&#8217. adopt a policy d&#8217. & #171. operating zero &#187. its workforce and consent prior free and informed d&#8217. land use. &#171. We are not auditeurs&#187., Poynton said. &#171. We do not say this qu&#8217 all businesses must be. We help develop responses to issues of interest. We help invent policies that they are met, and then we are going on the ground with them to build their capacity to implement these policies. &#187. With APA, he said, it took months just to design the policy.Poynton insists qu&#8217. n&#8217 is not here to play a role of-argued. &#171. We are painful, annoying, and strict. S &#8217. there are problems, we denounce l&#8217. agreement. C &#8217 is what we do when companies are not serious and open with us-when we constantly learn new things by the media, for example. &#187. It stresses that TFT has ended its discussions with a financial institution d&#8217 .envergure World (qu&#8217. n&#8217. has not wished to appoint), because it did not want to reveal the list of its clients.But Poyton is ready to stay alongside firms reputation busty, s&#8217. think their efforts are sincere. It gives such a public company which operates Indonesian teak forests on l&#8217. island of Java, Perum Perhutani. TFT spent six years to try to design a project for this company. It was paid by European and North American distributors that sell furniture manufactured with the wood Perhutani. In the same time, employees of the company were on the villagers who entered illegally in its forests to cut trees. &#171. Many activists have said that we should not work with Perhutani&# 187., he said. &#171. But when we reached an agreement in 2009, the rifles have disappeared from the forest very quickly. No n&#8217. has been killed since. Held good, and j&#8217. am proud. &#187. Is there a risk that TFT becomes a consultancy firm, more interested in protecting l&#8217. image of businesses and s&#8217. ensure new customers that they hold the knife to her throat? Poynton said it n&#8217. never happen. &#171. No chance. Of course, the border is sometimes close between greenwashing and real change. We l&#8217. accept. Often, we must rely on our instincts whether we should or not continue to work with a company. &#187. No militants d&#8217. NGOs which j&#8217. talked contests the sincerity of Poynton. N&#8217. It remains that it gives a lot of power to a single organization-and a single individual. And j&#8217. have heard murmurs of discontent among NGOs dedicated to the protection of forests and the rights of people who live there, and live. Elfian Effendi, l&#8217. organization Greenomics Indonesia, said that TFT &#171. promotes the violation of laws relating to l&#8217 .exploitation for̻ts&#187. by giving green light to its partner Golden Agri Resources to continue clearing forests on wide-ranging concessions d&#8217. palm oil in the province of Central Kalimantan-which are at the same time, so d̩boussolante, classified by the Indonesian Government as forests.They are reluctant to rely on l&#8217. instinct Poynton on the trust to give businesses. They would like to learn more about agreements qu&#8217. it is with firms, if possible by making public contracts online. And they would like detailed information on the strings d&#8217. supply, so qu&#8217. they can s&#8217. ensure themselves the veracity of claims of businesses. And where TFT advises firms on how to end working conditions exploitative or d&#8217. obtain the consent of local communities to land transactions, they think communities should also participate in the process.Some critics say the environmental promises may come into conflict with the social promises. The new policy of protecting the forest developed by the giant l&#8217. palm oil Golden Agri Resources, with l&#8217. using TFT and support of Greenpeace, is likely to fall into this through. Marcus Colchester, l&#8217. British organization Forest Peoples&# 8217. Programme, said l&#8217. application of this policy in the forests of central Borneo has led to a ban on fishing and d&#8217. other traditional activities of the local communities that they also claim a right on these forests. Who will speak for them?Poynton is sensitive to these criticisms. &#171. I will not reveal the content of my contracts, but I am prepared to discuss with NGOs &#187., he said. He thinks some of its critics have chosen the ease condemning the world of l&#8217 company rather than s&#8217. confront it. And it is convinced that its own approach is worth d&#8217. be followed. L &#8217 .enjeu, he said, goes beyond public relations s&#8217. this is changing the nature of business.Some company leaders d&#8217 understand. They realize qu&#8217. to prosper in the long term, they need strings d&#8217. sustainable supply for their raw materials, and brands to l&#8217. from risk r̩putationnels. Unilever, the main firm World l&#8217. food and products d&#8217. hygiene, s&#8217 is committed to reducing its environmental impact d&#8217. two by 2020. His boss Paul Polman said l&#8217. last year: &#171. If a company wants to s&#8217. ensure its longevity, the best guarantee is d&#8217. be useful to society. These principles have been forgotten in recent years, and we want to deliver to the taste of the day for the greater good of all. &#187. But if the major brands with reputations to lose can be malleable, qu&#8217. is it? Optimists hope world leaders can play a pioneering role and train others in their wake. The pessimists fear that others do consider the ethical claims of their competitors as a sign of weakness, and s&#8217 .empressent d&#8217. benefit. So there is a significant challenge that the traditional rival Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, follow the movement, l&#8217. other Asian giant l&#8217. palm oil to make common cause with Olam Wilmar, and this qu&#8217. APA is joined by its rival Asia Pacific Resources.S &#8217. it is really d&#8217. a turning point-d&#8217. a time when the &#171. the lowest race &#187. in d&#8217. business ethics becomes a race for? We will know soon.Fred Pearce &mdash. Photo :Rainforest Action Network CC

5979ea1b66cfee66fa06f362;R1683;social droits homme;Un an apr̬s le Rana Plaza, Auchan et Carrefour pas pr̻ts  assumer leurs responsabilit̩sIndustrie textileL۪effondrement de l۪immeuble du Rana Plaza, il y a un an, a alert̩ l۪opinion publique internationale sur les conditions de travail qui s̩vissent dans les usines textiles du Bangladesh. Sous la pression, les grandes marques de v̻tements occidentales ont annonc̩ des initiatives pour am̩liorer la situation des ouvri̬res. Malgr̩ des avanc̩es r̩elles, beaucoup de probl̬mes de fond restent irr̩solus. Illustration des r̩sistances au changement, les grandes entreprises fran̤aises impliqu̩es  notamment les groupes Auchan et Carrefour - refusent de contribuer  l۪indemnisation des victimes. Premier volet d&#8217.une enqu̻te sur les suites du Rana Plaza.Le 24 avril 2013 s۪effondrait  Dhaka, capitale du Bangladesh, l۪immeuble du Rana Plaza, qui abritait environ 5000 ouvriers et ouvri̬res textiles. Bilan : 1138 morts et plus de 2000 bless̩s, dont certains resteront handicap̩s  vie. Le b̢timent de neuf ̩tages  il ̩tait initialement pr̩vu pour n۪en avoir que cinq  comprenait cinq ateliers de confection, travaillant pour des marques aussi diverses que Benetton, Walmart ou Mango. Mais aussi sans doute pour Camaeu et Auchan (qui ne reconnąt qu۪une possible sous-traitance &#171. sauvage &#187.) et peut-̻tre pour Carrefour (qui nie tout lien avec le Rana Plaza). Le jour pr̩c̩dent, les ouvri̬res avaient remarqu̩ des fissures dans les murs, mais les patrons les avaient forc̩es  retourner au travail, en les mena̤ant de ne pas verser leurs salaires.L۪̩v̩nement a mobilis̩ comme jamais auparavant les m̩dias et l۪opinion publique internationale, mettant en lumi̬re les conditions de travail et de vie des ouvri̬res  majoritairement de tr̬s jeunes femmes  qui fabriquent les v̻tements commercialis̩s en Europe et en Am̩rique du Nord. Au Bangladesh m̻me, la catastrophe a entrąn̩ des manifestations de masse des travailleurs du textile, qui se sont poursuivies pendant plusieurs mois et n۪ont pas encore vraiment cess̩  ce jour (lire&#171. Depuis la catastrophe du Rana Plaza, les ouvri̬res du textile se sont radicalis̩es. &#187.). La pression conjugu̩e des ouvri̬res et de la communaut̩ internationale a forc̩ les ̩lites du Bangladesh et les multinationales du textile  des concessions. Les patrons des ateliers, malgr̩ leur proximit̩ avec les dirigeants du pays, sont aujourd۪hui derri̬re les barreaux.Du c̫t̩ des donneurs d۪ordres, plus de 150 marques ont sign̩ l۪Accord sur la s̩curit̩ des usines textiles au Bangladesh, en association avec les syndicats nationaux et internationaux, et sous l۪̩gide de l۪Organisation internationale du travail (OIT). Carrefour, Auchan, Leclerc, Casino et Camaeu en sont signataires. Cet accord social novateur pr̩voit notamment un programme d۪inspection des usines et un suivi transparent de ces inspections. Sur le papier, l۪Accord constitue une avanc̩e tr̬s significative, justifiant les espoirs de nombreux observateurs que le drame du Rana Plaza repr̩sentera un tournant d̩cisif en mati̬re de droits humains et de conditions de travail dans l۪industrie textile au Bangladesh  et m̻me, si possible, au-del.Mais derri̬re les effets d۪annonce  voire les autocongratulations  des groupes fran̤ais comme Carrefour et Auchan se cache une r̩alit̩ plus d̩rangeante[1]. Si elles affichent fi̬rement leur participation  l۪Accord, les marques fran̤aises   l۪exception de Camaeu  refusent encore cat̩goriquement de participer  la compensation des victimes. Dans le cadre de l۪Accord, l۪usine d۪un fournisseur d۪Auchan a ̩t̩ ferm̩e pour raisons de s̩curit̩, et il n۪est pas encore clair  ce jour si le groupe fran̤ais respectera ses engagements vis--vis des ouvri̬res concern̩es. Plus g̩n̩ralement, les fondements du syst̬me qui a men̩  la catastrophe du Rana Plaza et  une multitude d۪incidents de moindre envergure  des prix bas, des gros volumes, des d̩lais tr̬s courts  sont intacts. Et l۪on sent ces entreprises de moins en moins dispos̩es  s۪engager dans une d̩marche qui les obligerait  sortir de leurs modes de fonctionnement traditionnels, en leur imposant des contraintes et des obligations, et en les obligeant  une r̩elle transparence sur leur chąne d۪approvisionnement[2].Les ONG fran̤aises, emmen̩es par Peuples Solidaires et le collectif thique sur l۪̩tiquette, ontlanc̩ un appel(d̩j sign̩ par plus de 100 000 personnes)  Auchan et Carrefour (ainsi qu۪ Benetton)  contribuer au fonds d۪indemnisation des victimes et, au-del,  assumer effectivement leurs responsabilit̩s vis--vis des conditions de travail de des ouvri̬res de leurs sous-traitants. Au-del, elles esp̬rent profiter de l۪anniversaire du Rana Plaza pour faire avancer la proposition de loi sur le &#171. devoir de vigilance &#187. des multinationales fran̤aises vis--vis des atteintes aux droits de l۪homme dans leurs filiales et leur chąne d۪approvisionnement  l۪̩tranger. D̩pos̩e par trois d̩put̩s socialistes et ̩cologistes, laproposition est pour l۪instant au point mort, confront̩e  l۪opposition des lobbies ̩conomiques et du gouvernement. Unep̩tition en lignevient d&#8217.̻tre lanc̩e.Du c̫t̩ de Carrefour, on n۪a jamais reconnu aucun lien avec le Rana Plaza, bien que des syndicalistes bangladais aient retrouv̩ une ̩tiquette de sa marque Tex dans les d̩combres de l۪immeuble apr̬s la catastrophe. Des anciens ouvriers de l۪immeuble affirment avoir produit des T-shirts de marque Tex, mais il pourrait y avoir confusion avec une marque danoise[3]. Le cas Auchan est plus probl̩matique encore. L۪entreprise avait initialement ̩t̩ contrainte d۪admettre que des pantalons de marque In Extenso ̩taient fabriqu̩s au Rana Plaza, mais expliquait qu۪il s۪agissait d۪une production sous-trait̩e &#171. en cascade &#187. par l۪un de ses fournisseurs officiels, sans qu۪Auchan en ait ̩t̩ inform̩. R̩ponse des ONG : &#171.Le fait qu۪Auchan n۪ait pas ̩t̩ capable de mątriser sa production tout au long de sa chąne d۪approvisionnement ne la d̩douane en aucun cas de sa responsabilit̩ envers les victimes.&#187. Le groupe semble avoir choisi de durcir le ton. Dans uncommuniqu̩ r̩cemment diffus̩, Auchan affirme d̩sormais que son enqu̻te approfondie &#171.n۪a permis d۪apporter aucune preuve formelle&#187.. Ce qui n۪a pas emp̻ch̩ Auchan de &#171.mettre fin de mani̬re unilat̩rale  [ses] relations commerciales avec lui&#187.. (Apparemment, certains devraient droit au b̩n̩fice du doute, d۪autres non !) La conclusion est on ne peut plus claire : &#171.Auchan (_) n۪a pas de responsabilit̩ dans l۪effondrement du b̢timent.&#187.L۪attitude d۪Auchan et de Carrefour n۪est certes pas exceptionnelle  seulement dix entreprises se sont engag̩es formellement dans le dispositif d۪indemnisation (dit &#171. Arrangement &#187.), contre plus de 150 pour l۪&#171. Accord &#187. ! Les besoins financiers pour assurer une compensation &#171. juste, compl̬te et transparente &#187. aux victimes du Rana Plaza  couvrant les frais m̩dicaux et la perte de revenus, en conformit̩ avec les conventions pertinentes de l۪OIT  ont ̩t̩ estim̩s  40 millions de dollars (54 millions d۪euros), dont un peu moins de la moiti̩ doit ̻tre abond̩e par les donneurs d۪ordres internationaux. Une somme extr̻mement modeste compar̩e aux b̩n̩fices des entreprises concern̩es en 2013, comme le signalent Peuples solidaires et thique sur l۪̩tiquette : &#171.2,4 milliards [d۪euros] pour Inditex, 1,26 milliard pour Carrefour, 767 millions pour Auchan&#187.. Et pourtant,  ce jour, seulement 7 millions de dollars ont ̩t̩ promisselon l۪OIT, leGuardianavan̤antpour sa partle chiffre de 15 millions_ En attendant, gr̢ce aux contributions d۪ONG et de quelques entreprises comme Primark, des aides d۪urgences ont ̩t̩ vers̩es, de mani̬re al̩atoire et insuffisante au regard des besoins[4].Si Auchan et Carrefour se refusent aujourd۪hui encore  participer au fonds d۪indemnisation, c۪est probablement parce que ces entreprises consid̬rent un tel geste comme un aveu implicite de relation commerciale avec les entreprises du Rana Plaza, pouvant engager leur responsabilit̩ juridique[5]. La mise en place du fonds d۪indemnisation  fruit d۪une laborieuse n̩gociation entre entreprises et syndicats sous l۪̩gide de l۪OIT  s۪est faite pourtant avec beaucoup de pr̩cautions. Soin a ̩t̩ pris de dissocier contribution financi̬re au fonds et responsabilit̩ directe dans le drame, en pr̩cisant que les contributions pouvaient tr̬s bien ̻tre volontaires[6].Tout ceci n۪a visiblement pas suffi  apaiser les craintes dans les directions de Carrefour et Auchan. Leur attitude contraste avec celle d۪autres groupes europ̩ens, comme l۪irlandaise Primark (qui a contribu̩ au fonds en plus de mettre en place son propre programme d۪indemnisation), ou encore C&amp.A ou Inditex (Zara), qui ont contribu̩ au fonds sans pour autant avoir reconnu de production dans le Rana Plaza. M̻me les g̩ants am̩ricains Gap et Walmart  pourtant honnis de la soci̩t̩ civile internationale pour avoir refus̩ de signer l۪Accord et mis en place un programme concurrent moins contraignant  ont vers̩ des fonds !Si le groupe Carrefour apu se pr̩sentercomme un &#171.artisan de l۪Accord&#187., affirmant &#171.avoir tout fait pour qu۪il voit le jour&#187., et s۪il ne manque pas de se targuer de sa &#171.conduite exemplaire&#187., la r̩alit̩ parąt donc beaucoup moins reluisante. La mise en cause de la sous-traitance sauvage et le risque juridique paraissent des excuses bien commodes pour ne rien changer fondamentalement au syst̬me ̩tabli, et se d̩fausser de toute responsabilit̩ sur leurs fournisseurs.C۪est ce dont t̩moigne en particulier la ligne de d̩fense adopt̩e par Auchan. Dans la foul̩e du Rana Plaza, le groupe de grande distribution s۪est empress̩ d۪annoncer un &#171.plan de lutte contre la sous-traitance sauvage&#187.. Pourtant, ce sont bien les pratiques d۪achat d۪Auchan, Carrefour et autres qui cr̩ent, en imposant des d̩lais et des volumes excessifs pour des cots d̩fiant toute concurrence, le probl̬me de la sous-traitance sauvage. &#171.Auchan a bien entendu ̩t̩ boulevers̩ par cet ̩v̩nement, mais la responsabilit̩ de la catastrophe est celle de ceux qui ont oblig̩ les salari̩s  travailler dans un immeuble ne respectant pas les normes d۪urbanisme locales et pr̩sentant des risques visibles d۪effondrement.&#187., d̩clare aujourd۪hui le groupe. Qui, en effet, a contribu̩  placer les ouvri̬res dans cette situation ? Plut̫t que de r̩pondre  cette question, Auchan choisit d۪adopter un ton martial : en cas de violation par les fournisseurs des &#171.contrats commerciaux&#187. et des &#171.modes de relations habituels&#187., la sanction  ou &#171. d̩r̩f̩rencement &#187. - sera imm̩diate.Suite  l۪effondrement du Rana Plaza, Disney avait ̩t̩ vilipend̩e de toutes parts pour avoir d̩cid̩ unilat̩ralement de se retirer totalement du Bangladesh, laissant les ouvri̬res  leur sort apr̬s avoir exploit̩ leur travail et les privant, du m̻me coup, des opportunit̩s ̩conomiques et sociales offertes malgr̩ tout par l۪emploi textile[7]. Il ne semble pas que la d̩marche d۪Auchan soit fonci̬rement diff̩rente dans sa logique.Olivier PetitjeanLire lesecond voletde cette enqu̻te, sur la mise en oeuvre de l&#8217.Accord sur la s̩curit̩ des usines et le besoin de normes contraignantes en mati̬re de responsabilit̩ des multinationales.&mdash.Photo :rijans CC[1]Aussi bien Auchan que Carrefour ont totalement verrouill̩ leur communication officielle sur ces questions, refusant de r̩pondre aux questions ou aux interviews qui pourraient les faire d̩vier du script ̩tabli.[3]Voir  ce sujet lefilm documentaireLes damn̩es du low-cost, diffus̩ par France 5  l۪occasion de l۪anniversaire du Rana Plaza.[4]Selon leGuardian, pr̬s de deux cent ouvri̬res sont encore port̩es disparues, leurs corps n۪ayant pas ̩t̩ officiellement retrouv̩ dans les d̩combres. De sorte que leurs familles n۪ont pas droit  compensation.[5]Comme le rapporte cetarticleduNew York Times, le groupe espagnol Mango avait lui aussi choisi un ligne similaire pour refuser toute participation  l۪indemnisation. Mango est depuis revenu sur cette position.[6]D۪ailleurs, nombre des entreprises contributrices au fonds d۪indemnisation ont particip̩ par le biais d۪organisations caritatives internes (la &#171. Fondation C&amp.A &#187.) ou externes (notamment l۪ONG BRAC).[1][2][3][4][5][6][7];A year after the Rana Plaza, Auchan and Carrefour not ready to assume their responsibilities Textile Industry The collapse of the building Rana Plaza, there is a year, alerted the international public opinion on working conditions in the textile mills of Bangladesh. Under pressure, the major brands of Western clothing announced initiatives to improve the situation of workers. Despite real advances, many substantive issues remain unresolved. Illustration of resistance to change, the major French companies involved-including groups Auchan and Carrefour-refuse to contribute to compensation for victims. First door d&#8217. a survey of the Rana Plaza.April 24, 2013 collapsed in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, the building of the Rana Plaza, which housed about 5000 workers and textile workers. Balance: 1138 dead and more than 2000 injured, some will remain disabled for life. The nine storey building-it was originally scheduled for only have five-included five garment workshops, working for brands as diverse as Benetton, Mango or Walmart. But also probably for Vons and Auchan (which recognizes that a possible outsourcing &#171. wild &#187.) and perhaps for Carrefour (which denies any link with the Rana Plaza). The previous day, workers had noticed cracks in the walls, but the bosses were forced to return to work, threatening to not pay their salaries.The event has mobilized as never before the media and international public opinion, highlighting the working conditions and living labour majority of very young women-who manufacture the clothing marketed in Europe and North America. In Bangladesh, the disaster has resulted in mass demonstrations textile workers, which continued for several months and have not yet really ceased to date (lire&#171. Since the Rana Plaza disaster, the textile workers were radicalized. &#187.). The pressure coupled with workers and the international community has forced the elites of Bangladesh and the multinationals of the textile concessions. The patterns workshops, despite their proximity to the country's leaders, are now behind bars.On the side donors orders, more than 150 brands have signed the Agreement on the safety of textile mills in Bangladesh, in association with the national and international unions, and under the auspices of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Carrefour, Auchan, Leclerc, Casino and cameo are signatories. This innovative social agreement includes an inspection program factories and monitoring transparent these inspections. On paper, the Agreement is a very significant step, justifying the hopes of many observers that the tragedy of Rana Plaza will be a decisive turning point in human rights and working conditions in the textile industry in Bangladesh-and even, if possible, beyond.But behind the effects of announcement-even congratulation-French groups such as Carrefour and Auchan lies a reality more disturbing [ 1 ]. If they proudly displayed their participation in the Agreement, the French brands-with the exception of Vons-still categorically refuse to participate in the compensation of victims. As part of the Agreement, the plant a Auchan provider was closed for security reasons, and it is not yet clear to date if the French group will meet its commitments to workers concerned. More generally, the foundations of the system that led to the disaster of the Rana Plaza and a multitude of smaller problems-low prices, large volumes, very short time-are intact. And we feel these companies less and less willing to engage in a process that would leave their modes of operation traditional, by imposing constraints and obligations, and forcing a real transparency on their supply chain [ 2 ].French NGOs, led by Peuples Solidaires and the collective Ethics on the label, ontlanc̩ a call (already signed by more than 100 000 people) to Auchan and Carrefour (and Benetton) to contribute to the compensation fund for victims and, beyond, to assume their responsibilities effectively towards the working conditions of workers of their subcontractors. Beyond that, they hope to take advantage of the anniversary of the Rana Plaza to advance the proposed law on the &#171. duty of vigilance &#187. French multinationals towards violations of human rights in their subsidiaries and their supply chain abroad. Filed by three members socialists and environmentalists, build is currently stalled, facing opposition from economic lobbies and government. Unep̩tition lignevient d&#8217. be launched.Side of Carrefour, has never recognized any link with the Rana Plaza, although trade unionists of Bangladesh have found a label of its mark Tex in the rubble of the building after the disaster. Former workers in the building say they produced T-shirts mark Tex, but there may be confusion with a Danish brand [ 3 ]. The case is more problematic still Auchan. The company had initially been forced to admit that pants mark In Extenso were manufactured in Rana Plaza, but explained that it was a production outsourced &#171. cascading &#187. by one of its official suppliers, without Auchan has been informed. Response from NGOs: &#171. The fact that Auchan has not been able to control its production throughout its supply chain to clear any of its responsibility to the victims. &#187. The group appears to have chosen to harden the tone. In uncommuniqu̩ recently released, Auchan now says that its in-depth investigation &#171. did not provide any evidence of formelle&#187.. This has not prevented Auchan &#171. end unilaterally to [ its ] trade relations with lui&#187.. (Apparently, some should right to benefit of the doubt, other non!) The conclusion is it clear: &#171. Auchan (...) has no responsibility for the collapse of the building. &#187. The attitude of Auchan and Carrefour is certainly not exceptional-only ten companies engaged formally in the compensation device (said &#171. Agreement &#187.), compared to more than 150 for the &#171. Agreement &#187.! The financial needs to ensure compensation &#171. just, comprehensive and transparent &#187. the victims of Rana Plaza-covering the medical expenses and loss of income, in accordance with the relevant ILO conventions-have been estimated at 40 million dollars (54 million euros), including a little less than half must be funded by donors international orders. An extremely modest sum compared with corporate profits involved in 2013, as reported Peoples solidarity and Ethics on the label: &#171. 2, 4 billion [ euros ] for Inditex, 1.26 billion for Carrefour, 767 million for Auchan&# 187.. Yet, to date, only 7 million dollars were promisselon ILO, leGuardianavan̤antpour its partle figure of 15 million ... In the meantime, thanks to the contributions of NGOs and a few businesses such as Primark, aid emergencies were paid, randomly and insufficient in relation to the needs [ 4 ].If Auchan and Carrefour still today refuse to participate in the compensation fund, which is probably because these companies consider such a gesture as an implicit admission of business relationship with companies Rana Plaza, which can engage their legal responsibility [ 5 ]. The establishment of the compensation fund-a result of laborious negotiations between companies and unions under the aegis of the ILO-has made yet with great precautions. Care has been taken to separate financial contribution to the funds and direct responsibility in the tragedy, adding that the contributions could very well be voluntary [ 6 ].All this has clearly not enough to allay fears in the branches of Carrefour and Auchan. Their attitude contrasts with other European groups, such as the Irish Primark (which contributed to the funds in addition to place its own compensation program), or A or C &amp. Inditex (Zara), which have contributed to the funds without having recognized production in the Rana Plaza. Even the American giants Gap and Walmart-yet despised international civil society for refusing to sign the Agreement and set up a competing program less binding-have provided funding!If the group Carrefour is to pr̩sentercomme a &#171. architect of the Accord&# 187., saying &#171. have done everything to see the jour&#187., and if it is boast of its &#171. conduct exemplaire&#187., the reality is therefore much less glamorous. The implementation of the outsourcing wild and legal risk seem convenient excuses for not fundamentally change the system established, and discard any responsibility on their suppliers.That is what is particularly line of defence adopted by Auchan. In the wake of the Rana Plaza, the large distribution group is eager to announce a &#171. plan to combat outsourcing sauvage&#187.. Yet, it is the purchasing practices of Auchan, Carrefour and other create, by imposing deadlines and excessive volumes for costs defying any competition, the problem of outsourcing wild. &#171. Auchan has of course been shocked by this event, but the responsibility for the disaster is those who forced employees to work in a building not respecting the standards of local planning and risk visible collapse. &#187., Said today the group. Who, indeed, has helped put the workers in this situation? Rather than answer this question, Auchan chooses to adopt a martial tone: in case of violation by the suppliers of &#171. contracts commerciaux&#187. and &#171. modes of relationships habituels&#187., the penalty-or &#171. Dereferencing &#187.-will be immediate.Following the collapse of the Rana Plaza, Disney was reviled for all sides have decided unilaterally to withdraw completely from Bangladesh, leaving the workers to their fate after exploited their work and depriving, at the same time, economic opportunities and social opportunities despite employment textile [ 7 ]. It does not seem that the approach of Auchan is fundamentally different in its logic.Olivier Petitjean Read Pas voletde this investigation, on the implementation of l&#8217.

597a05b7d848472c164d1b49;R1871;HS;"Be Kind, Rewind: 10 Best Spiritual TV Series to Gift This ChristmasCommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantThis Christmas, for the spirituality-and-pop-culture enthusiasts on your gifting list, consider the following: Be kind and rewind.Give them the gift that keeps on giving ... long after the series has been canceled.1.Rev.This post began when I started snooping around to see when my new favorite show might start shooting its third season.Rev.is a BBC series heading (happily, I learned) into its third season that the British television network describes, simply, as: ""A sitcom about a vicar running a modern inner-city church, with a reluctant wife and a depleted, motley congregation.""Oh, but it's so much more than that.The series, which premiered in 2010, revolves around the Rev. Adam Smallbone (Tom Hollander), a Church of England vicar serving a down-on-its-luck parish in a dodgy part of East London called, inexplicably, St. Saviour in the Marshes. The humor (and the pathos) derives from Smallbone's wistfully human, begrudgingly believing, perpetually struggling ministry as an urban priest facing the challenges of keeping the ship (of fools) afloat. Adam is forever juggling financial, personal, and political pressures (of internal church politics, that is) while trying his best to best serve his ""motley"" crew and be a dutiful, loving husband to his solicitor wife, Alex.I adore this show. It's clever and funny and spiritually intriguing without being goofy, snarky, or facile. And, I was delighted to learn, in August the BBC announced that it has ordered a third (and apparently final) season ofRev.that will begin airing in ... 2014. GADS! It's a long wait. So in the meantime, I recommend tuning in online or ordering the DVDs for yourself and the clergyperson (or fan thereof) in your life.http://youtu.be/mGfsd03KZAQDownload the series to date (Season 1 &amp. 2 and the Christmas Special) online at various retailers listedHERE. Or watch online via theBBC.2.Northern ExposureIt's been off the air since 1995, but it still is, to my mind at least, the very best television series. Ever. Full stop.Set in the fictitious town of Cicely, Alaska, for six seasons (and 110 episodes),Northern Exposurebroke new ground as it followed the denizens of one small town. It was wacky and wonderful, full of smart dialogue and story lines that more often than not contained deep, probing and insightful spiritual questions (and occasionally answers). Led by the resident philosophical ex-convict-turned-disc-jockey and ersatz shaman/guru/pastor Chris Stevens (John Corbett) the characters explored joys, foibles, struggles, and hilarity of the inner and outer life.I cried when this show went off the air and wrote my first official seminary paper on its spiritual content and message. While it's almost 25 years old now, the content has aged well. If you've never seen it, treat yourself to a season or two. And if you have a diehardNEfan on your list...see below for the ultimate gift.http://youtu.be/U2TPMoP01ScSadly,NEisn't available for viewing online anywhere, but you can purchase the entire series onDVD(and it comes in the faux-shearling bag pictured above -- I own the set and it's one of my prized possessions) oras individual seasons(there are six).3.The Vicar of DibleyMost of your are no strangers to the adventures of the Rev. Boadicea Julie Andrews Dick Van Dyke Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Chim Chiminee Chim Chiminee Chim Chimcharee""Geraldine""(or ""Gerry"") Granger (Dawn French) and the parish of Dibley. For the few uninitiated, the BBC series that aired first in 1994 and ran (on and off, as those British series are wont to do) until 2007, centers around a female Church of England priest and the rural parish she serves that's never seen a vicar of her persuasion before. Hilarity (and pretty savvy spiritual insights from time to time) ensue.http://youtu.be/NIi7LXNRZjsYou can buy the whole megillah -- ""The Immaculate Collection,"" as it's called -- a box set that includes Series 1 - 3.

The dramatic series starred Adain Quinn as the Rev. Daniel Webster, an ""unconventional"" Episcopal priest in Newbury, New York (a suburb of New York City.)The Book of Danielwas the first television series to air new episodes via online streaming after its cancelation. Eight episodes ran altogether between the month-long television run on NBC and the streaming run on NBC.com.It's not an easy show and took theological/religious risks, but it's great and brave storytelling, very much worth watching.http://youtu.be/AJ4450POnFsBuy thecomplete series on DVDor watch the entire series for free in its entirety onYouTube.8.Lie to MeNot a clergyperson in site in this show based on the work of real-life Dr.Paul Ekman, a psychologist and expert on body language and facial expressions. Tim Roth played Dr. Carl Lightman (the Ekman-esque character) for three seasons (2009-2011) and I hung on every word of every single one of them.There's no explicitly religious content in the series, but it explored in great detail and often with admirable nuance, the nature of truth. What is true? What is a lie? Why do we lie? How can you tell? Why can you tell?Does anyone really know anyone else? Or do we only let people see the truth about us that we want them to see?Fascinating series. And you'll never look at anyone quite the same way again. (Watch that shoulder shrug.)http://youtu.be/etJ0Ofut-HEWatch all three seasons onNetflix,buy the DVD series, or download it onAmazon Instant Videoor iTunes.9.Pushing DaisiesNed is a pie maker who has the ability to bring things (and people) back to life by touching them. But rules and restrictions apply. (Don't they always?)What's not to love about this quirky dramedy -- co-starring one of our favorite people, Kristen Chenoweth -- that ran on ABC from 2007 to 2009?Nothing. That's what.http://youtu.be/F_ACR26qhKMWatch full episodes on theWB Web siteor give the complete series as a gift onDVDorAmazon Instant Download,or iTunes.10.LostIt started with a plane crash and ended with ... purgatory?Maybe?I don't know for sure.

Cos i big dell'agroalimentare tentano di boicottarli.  quello che sta accadendo aJust Mayo, lamaionesesenza uova diHampton Creek,accusata da Unilever di non essere ""maionese"".MAIONESE SENZA UOVA- Unilever, che detiene la quota maggiore del mercato della maionese negli Stati Uniti,stimatocon un valore di 2 miliardi di dollari all'anno, ha denunciato la piccola Hampton Creek perpubblicit ingannevole e pratiche di business scorrette.Il motivo?Just Mayo non contiene uova.Questo ̬ il punto su cui si basa l'intera vicenda.HAMPTON CREEK- Hampton Creek, start up dell'alimentare vegatle di San Francisco nata nel 2011, ha ottenuto una grande popolarit (anche in termini finanziari) per il suo approccio scientifico nell۪offerta diprodotti a base di vegetali che non contengono uova,al centro di un۪industria crudele nei confronti degli animali. Just Mayo, in particolare, ha letteralmente fatto registrare un boom, e non soltanto tra vegetariani o vegani. Il prodotto, infatti, negli Usa ormai si trova ovunque, anche da Walmart, Costco, Target e Dollar Tree.LA REAZIONE DI UNILEVER Ma Just Mayo non ̬ una maionese, hanno detto dalla grande azienda, perch̩il dizionario e la Food and Drug Administrationdefinisconomaionese un prodotto che contiene uova.Unilever, quindi, tentadi boicottarla e bloccarla, rimarcando che Hampton Creek is seizing market share from Unilever۪s Best Foods and Hellmann۪s brands of mayonnaise products۝ (Hampton Creek sta sottraendo una fetta di mercato).La denuncia legale, quindi, ̬ semplicemente lareazione alla perdita del suo dominio incontrastato nel redditizio settore della maionese.Tanto pi_ che negli Usa si avvicina il giorno del Ringraziamento, la giornata col secondo picco pi_ alto dei consumi di maionese in tutto l'anno, dopo il quattro di luglio, il Giorno dell'Indipendenza.LA PETIZIONE Ma consumatori e appassionati di alternative vegetali non ci stanno. Lo chefAndrew Zimmern,ad esempio, definisce questa azione come""bullismo"" di Unilever sulla piccola aziendanellapetizione che ha lanciato su Change.org, in cui prega la multinazionale ""di concentrarsi maggiormente sulla creazione di un mondo migliore, piuttosto che impedire ad altri di tentare di farlo"".MAIONESE VS CONDIMENTO- Tuttavia, comespiegail New York Times,anche Unilever ha i suoi problemi di maionese.La scorsa settimana, l'azienda sembra aver iniziato a modificare il proprio sito web e i messaggi di social media, apponendo la dicitura""condimento"" in vari riferimenti alla maionesequando il prodotto specifico non soddisfaceva gli standard della FDA per la maiones (gli stessi citati contro Just Mayo). Inoltre l'azienda avrebbe anche modificato i commenti di un cliente che elogiava un prodotto usando le parole ""maionese"" e ""mayo"".Resta il fatto, in ogni caso, che forse non ̬ al consumatore che interessano le definizioni. E che sul mercato sta vincendo chi riesce a cambiare i vecchi paradigmi, intercettando i desideri e le necessit di coloro che oggi vogliono mangiare in maniera pi_ etica e responsabile. Voi che ne pensate?Roberta RagniLEGGI anche:La rivoluzione del ""fake"" food: arrivano le uova e il pollo vegetaliCome preparare in casa la maionese (classica e vegan)";"The vegan products, ethical and sustainable not like all the multinationals, especially when erode a part of their profits. So the big of the agri-food attempt to boycott. That's what's happening aJust Mayo, lamaionesesenza eggs diHampton Creek, accused by Unilever not be ""mayonnaise"".MAIONESE WITHOUT EGGS-Unilever, which holds the largest share of the market of mayonnaise in the United States, stimatocon a value of 2 billion dollars a year, denounced the little Hampton Creek perpubblicit deceptive business practices and unfair. The reason ?Just Mayo doesn't contain eggs. This is the point on which you based the entire affair.HAMPTON RESERVlOR-Hampton Creek, start up the food vegatle of San Francisco was born in 2011, has won a great popularity (even in financial terms) for his scientific approach in offering diprodotti based on plants that do not contain eggs, at the center of a cruel industry towards the animals. Just Mayo, in particular, has literally did register a boom, and not just between vegetarian or vegan. The product, in fact, in the U.S. now is everywhere, even from Walmart, Costco, Target and Dollar Tree.THE REACTION OF UNILEVER-But Just Mayo is not a mayonnaise, they said from the big company, perch̩il dictionary and the Food and Drug Administrationdefinisconomaionese a product that contains uova.Unilever, so, tentadi boycott and lock it, signaling that ""Hampton Creek is seizing market share from Unilever's Best Foods and Hellmann's brands of mayonnaise products"" (Hampton Creek is taking a slice of the market).The legal complaint, therefore, is simply lareazione the loss of its domain unchallenged in the lucrative field of mayonnaise. Just more U.S. approaches on Thanksgiving, the day with the second highest peak of consumption of mayonnaise throughout the year, after four in July, the Day of Independence.THE PETIZIONE-But consumers and fans plant there are alternatives. The chefAndrew Zimmern, for example, defines this action as ""bullying"" of Unilever on the small aziendanellapetizione that launched on Change.org, where the multinational prays ""to focus more on creating a better world, rather than prevent others to try to do so"".MAIONESE VS ******-However, comespiegail New York Times, Unilever also has its problems of mayonnaise. Last week, the company seems to have started to change their website and messages of social media, appending the words ""dressing"" in various references to maionesequando the specific product does not meet the standards of the FDA for the maiones (the same sued against Just Mayo). In addition the company would also changed the comments of a customer who praised a product using the words ""mayo"" and ""mayo"".The fact remains, in any case, which may not be the consumer that affect the definitions. And on the market is winning who can change the old paradigms, intercepting the wishes and the needs of those who today want to eat a more ethical and responsible.

Foltz has a recipe to help the world's poor: Take one part entrepreneurship, one part social media savvy and one part faith-based motivation. Fold in the world's largest retailer.Then add water.If every American spent $10 per year on his Humankind Water  less than they spend on Halloween candy  it would be enough to nearly eradicate the world's water sanitation problems, Foltz says.Foltz, a former Christian youth minister, put out his first bottle ofHumankind Waterlast October. The idea is to sell bottled water in a socially conscious way, with 100 percent of net profits going to fund clean-water projects in Haiti, Asia and Africa.Then he heard about the ""Get on the Shelf"" contest by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., an ""American Idol""-style contest to open shelf space in selected Wal-Mart stores to small businesses and entrepreneurial inventors.The 4,300 participants in the contest only had to submit a video featuring a potentially marketable product and let social media do the rest. The top three winners would be sold through Walmart.com, but only the first-place winner would gain a coveted space in Wal-Mart stores.More than 1 million votes were cast in the competition fueled by social media like Facebook and Twitter. Though winning the contest doesn۪t guarantee Humankind a place on the shelf of every Wal-Mart store, the mega retailer will help the small organization develop and execute a targeted marketing and distribution plan.""Wal-Mart is giving us preferential shelf space, more grace than any other product during the honeymoon, and access to their storehouse of knowledge on the topic of water,"" Foltz said. ""No one sells more"" bottled water than Wal-Mart.Humankind Water, which has both a for-profit arm that sells water and a nonprofit foundation that accepts donations, exists [solely] to raise money and awareness to help wipe out the world's drinking water crisis,۝ said Foltz.The chances of winning a contest with over 4,300 competitors is like winning the NCAA [basketball] field of 64, then winning 64 tournaments like it in a row,۝ Foltz said.A regular on the youth ministry speaking circuit, Foltz had never intended to become an inventor. Instead, he had originally hoped to become a sportscaster before taking up a career working with Christian youth.It۪s so ridiculously improbable that the only thing I can say is that it۪s a miracle,۝ he said.He credits his Wal-Mart win to a blend of a focused new media campaign, strategic connections in the evangelical community, months of labor on the part of a committed team of friends  and more than a bit of divine inspiration.Foltz said the idea of selling bottled water to pay for clean water systems came to him roughly three years ago. I was praying, and the idea popped into my head,"" he said. When he shared the notion with two friends who had business smarts, I expected them to tell me that I was nuts, but they both loved the idea.۝One of Humankind Water۪s biggest boosters is youth minister Billy Dunn, a Christian radio personality in Allentown, Pa., who helped Foltz develop a business plan modeled on the success of the Ethos۝ bottled water marketed by Starbucks.Dunn۪s radio station, WORD-FM, donated thousands of dollars in free advertising for the Wal-Mart campaign, spreading the news to potential voters and supporters. The word was then spread to Christian leaders around the U.S., asking them to cast votes on Wal-Mart's website for Humankind.The idea of providing a clean cup of water to a child transcends all beliefs,۝ said Dunn, noting that the clean water project grants will go to secular and religious recipients alike. There۪s no spirituality about that. People need clean water.۝One of Foltz's supporters was James Vitray, a former member of the youth group at the Episcopal Church of the Good Samaritan in Paoli, Pa., which Foltz once led. He's now an independent software consultant, and provided the majority of Humankind's startup costs for the past year.One of my passions here in the United States is that people get less of an ethnocentric view, and more of a global view of (the question) who is my neighbor,۪۝ said Vitray, who became a champion of clean water after seeing the cholera clinics in Haiti and other countries. Unclean water kills more children daily than AIDS, malaria, measles and warfare combined, according to Humankind.Foltz has left his day job at the American branch of the Bible-education organization Scripture Union to work full-time on his water project. He's still not entirely sure how he'll make a living. ""We۪re celebrating now. We۪re over the moon,۝ said Foltz. But polluted water kills 10,000 children a day.۝The campaign is not without potential headaches. Wal-Mart's labor policies and hard-nosed competition have been criticized by labor groups and activist groups, and Foltz said he's sensitive to such critiques.Still, there is no way anyone is ever going to hear me bite the hand that feeds on this one _ they seem genuinely thrilled that we۪ve won. Their stores are going to be a part of leveraging money that will save children۪s lives. Call that a publicity boon, but in reality, it۪s going to do just that.۝He's also realistic about the amount of work that's yet to come.We haven۪t saved anybody۪s life yet.۝Elizabeth Evanswrites forReligion News Service.ViaRNS.View the discussion thread.I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them.

597a0721d848472c164d1c67;R1895;HS;"Today۪s International Women۪s Day Is Nothing Like Its Socialist RootsCommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantShould progressives participate in International Women۪s Day?Though March 8 is a calendar date familiar to anyone who works for equality, in recent years the message of International Women۪s Day has steadily become tied up with corporatization. In 2017, International Women۪s Day isofficially sponsored by BP, Western Union and Pepsico, among other multinational companies. Civil society, NGOs, and activist groups who work on women۪s issues are missing from the world۪s celebration of women۪s work, instead replaced by corporate logos.Of course, it wasn۪t always this way. One only needs to look at the history of International Women۪s Day to see how today۪s corporate version is buffed down from the truly cutting-edge protests and strikes of the early 20thcentury  ones planted firmly in socialist history.The Socialist Party in New York organized the first Women۪s Day demonstration in February 1909. National Woman۪s Day (as it was called then) involved mass strikes by female factory workers and a march through New York City. They marched for the right to unionize and for better wages, an attempt largely met with scorn from factory owners.A year later, Clara Zetkin, leader of the Women's Office۝ for the Social Democratic Party in Germany,proposed the ideaof an annual International Working Women۪s Day. Speaking to a conference of more than one hundred delegates from the U.S. and Europe,Zetkin arguedthat the struggle for women۪s work protections and wages should be celebrated by women around the world on the last Sunday in February.By 1911, national socialist parties in Sweden, Austria, and Germany organized more thanone millionwomen and men in a march against poverty, crippling work conditions, and the rising threat of war. A century before this year's Women۪s March, socialists galvanized working citizens into political participation in numbers previously unseen.That same year, a dramatic and terrible fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factorykilled 146 workers, nearly all of them immigrant women. In the wake of this tragedy and factory workers۪ protests, the state of New York adopted new safety legislations for workers.Perhaps the most sweeping Women۪s Day action is among the least remembered by many Americans. In 1917, after powerful International Working Women۪s Day protests,128,000 workerswent on strike in Russia and marched against the Tsarist government۪s failure to protect its citizens during World War I  what came to be known as the February Revolution. Most protesters werewives of soldiers, who struggled to feed their families as the price of grain skyrocketed. Their momentum led to the overthrow of the Tsarist regime  one of the most powerful states in history.Their victory was limited  the communist government that rose after the Tsarist state would go on to commit horrific human rights abuses of its own. As the Cold War settled in and socialist organizations were censored by U.S. intelligence, U.S. citizens chilled in their popular attitude toward socialism and the working women۪s platform.With feminism resurging in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.N. reincarnated International Women۪s Day in 1975 as part ofInternational Women۪s Year,۝but with little of its former focus on workers. By 1977, the day was formally proclaimed a celebration of women۪s rights and world peace. This new iteration advocated for parity in business and government, where it has more or less remained ever since.Christians should remember the radical economic message of the earliest Women's Days. A Women۪s Day rooted in anti-capitalism is an effective activist strategy  strikes and protests based on wages and anti-war messages historically have strengthened the right to unionize, emboldened the suffrage movement, and have overturned empires.Jesus rejected even holy actions tainted with money, reminding us, You cannot serve both God and money.۝ (Matt. 6:24) We cannot claim to be leading a justice movement if we do not critique the companies that exploit our sisters۪ labor, pollute our water, and poison our air. We cannot truly work for the kin-dom of God while agreeing to fit a women's movement into a capitalist box.Jesus divorced money from his work when he cast out the money changers from the temple. So too we must also remove corrupt money changers from our holy work of justice. This includes refusing to let BP  who pollutes our water and food and threatens jobs for women in the Gulf  represent a better future for women۪s lives.There is at least one unique opportunity to detach from the corporate sponsors this year. The organizers of January۪s Women۪s March are organizing a Day Without A Woman.۝ Women who can will take the day off of work and fast from purchasing and consuming on March 8  continuing the practice of striking that began with International Working Women۪s Day.This kind of strike is not possible for all women. But wherever we can and whatever we do to fast from exploitative corporations on March 8 will offer incisive critiques of unrecognized labor, unfair pay, and an economy that still, 100 years later, prioritizes wealth over the well-being of women.Lucy Hadley is a Campaigns and Communications Assistant for Sojourners.View the discussion thread.I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them.

The stolen moose reemerged in the association's home town onNew Year's eve.The association needed the 3 meters long and 2 meters high moose - a large version of a well known and widely sold rocking horse in the shape of a moose - for their annual New Year's stunt, De Stentor reports. This year's stunt was aimed at celebrating the many births in their town in 2015.The special moose was shown off to all visitors of the town's New Year's celebration on New Year's Eve.

The transition to the renewable energy is also optimal for costs, Google and the average consumer : when there's a buyer of electricity so powerful, the price drops quickly, for everyone. The transition to the renewable energy will be for 95% with direct use of renewables.   But ... how will the (few) places where the infrastructure alone and wind there's still no ? These days Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Goldman Sachs, Siemens, Johnson and Johnsonhanno promised to transizionare completely to solar in the next few years, adhering to the project RE100 promoted from ""The Climate Group"" a nonprofit americanafondata about a year ago, after the poof of climate in New York. In total are 36 of the mega-corporations that have volontariamentedeciso to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide and use only green energy.  In addition to the four on mentioned, are part of RE100, the Nikes, the Procter and Gamble, IKEA, Nestl̩, H and M. Johnson & Johnson produces shampoo and affinity.  Announce of wanting to get to 100% of solar by 2050.  Goldman Sachs, 100% solar by 2020, Nike 100% solar in 2025.  Steelcase produces furniture made in the USA.  It's already 100% solar and so on Voya International, real estate fund.  Amazon, Apple and Google have already implemented solar programs many years ago.  The Siemens says invest ' 100 million euros to go to 100% renewable by 2030. In total the thirty-six partners of RE100 are Alstria, Autodesk, BT Group, Commerzbank, DSM, Elion Resources Group, Formula E, Givaudan, Goldman Sachs, H and M, IKEA Group, Infosys, J.

Not bad, after a single year of activity, and a sign that the great march of a year ago has had some real implications. Meanwhile, I'm circa400 organizations that have decided to divestire from fossil sources, following the appeal of Bill Mc Kibben 350.org. What seemed to be a small group of utopian dreamers became a planetary movement.  In their complex, participating in the ""divestment committment"" worth $ 2.6 trillion dollars, which is 2,600,000 million dollars.   Among the magnificent 400, campus Americans, religious and philanthropic groups, pension funds and local authorities.  Even the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation is part of this group. As said, we don't know why these companies have decided to switch to renewables and schedule their companies for a future I can oil-free. Of course is the push towards green energy from the bottom becomes ever stronger and it's always more econonicamente beneficial use the renewables.  According to some studies of the Climate Group, transizionare to solar causes returns of 27% on initial investments. And yes, I know that some of these companies, such as the Nestle are not to be taken for example for almost nothing, but the fact is that even if the Nestle convinces itself to join the club of renewables, then that really means the future is bright.

5979ea0466cfee66fa06f34c;R1681;social - droits homme;Anniversaire du Rana Plaza : la responsabilit̩ des multinationales pas encore  l۪ordre du jour en FranceTextileIl y a un an s&#8217.effondrait l۪immeuble du Rana Plaza, au Bangladesh, faisant 1138 morts et plus de 2000 bless̩s, pour la plupart de jeunes ouvri̬res du secteur textile. Cette catastrophe - la plus importante de l&#8217.histoire industrielle moderne - a entrąn̩ une prise de conscience de la communaut̩ internationale et oblig̩ les multinationales du secteur  prendre des engagements in̩dits pour am̩liorer les conditions de travail dans les usines de leurs fournisseurs. Mais les avanc̩es (bien r̩elles) obtenues depuis le drame restent  concr̩tiser, notamment au niveau juridique. Second volet de notre enqu̻te sur les suites du Rana Plaza.Lerefus de groupes comme Carrefour ou Auchande s۪engager formellement dans la d̩marche de compensation des victimes du Rana Plaza refl̬te malheureuse une frilosit̩ plus g̩n̩rale. Si des firmes qui ont toutes deux r̩alis̩ plusieurs centaines de millions d&#8217.euros de b̩n̩fices en 2013 refusent de contribuer, m̻me symboliquement,  un fonds d&#8217.indemnisation des victimes qui ne s&#8217.̩l̬ve pas  plus de 40 millions de dollars en tout, comment esp̩rer un changement r̩el dans les rapports de force ̩conomiques et politiques de l&#8217.industrie textile mondiale ? Une telle attitude ne peut que peser sur la mise en uvre effective de l۪Accord sur la s̩curit̩ des usines, sign̩ par plus de 150 marques occidentales dans la foul̩e de la catastrophe, et qui en repr̩sente aux yeux de beaucoup l&#8217.h̩ritage le plus positif.Et certes, la signature de l&#8217.Accord repr̩sente un pas en avant consid̩rable en vue d&#8217.assurer une responsabilit̩ effective des entreprises multinationales vis--vis de leur chaine d۪approvisionnement  un objectif qui ̩tait rest̩ hors de port̩e malgr̩ vingt ans de beaux discours sur le d̩veloppement durable et la &#171. responsabilit̩ soci̩tale des entreprises &#187. (RSE). Pour la toute premi̬re fois, gr̢ce  la pression de l۪opinion publique et de la communaut̩ internationale, les entreprises signataires se sont engag̩es dans un processus ind̩pendant et contraignant d۪inspection et de mise aux normes des usines de leurs fournisseurs. L۪Accord pr̩voit une transparence totale sur les usines visit̩es, le r̩sultat des inspections et le suivi des travaux  r̩aliser (mais non, significativement, sur les donneurs d۪ordres qui s۪y approvisionnent). Le financement de l۪op̩ration sera assur̩ par les entreprises, en proportion du volume de production sous-trait̩ au Bangladesh. Les litiges ̩ventuels seront tranch̩s par la justice du pays d۪origine des firmes, en vertu de la Convention de New York pour l۪arbitrage des conflits commerciaux internationaux.C۪est pr̩cis̩ment la raison all̩gu̩e par Gap et Walmart pour ne pas avoir sign̩ l۪Accord, lequel ouvrirait la voie, selon elles, dans le contexte judiciaire am̩ricain,  une responsabilit̩ &#171. illimit̩e &#187. des donneurs d۪ordres. Les lobbies ̩conomiques am̩ricains ont faitpubliquement campagnecontre l۪Accord, et Gap et Walmart ont fini par mettre en place unprocessus parall̬le, moins contraignant et sans participation des travailleurs aux inspections[1]. &#171.Ce que Gap demande c۪est le droit de revenir sur ses engagements quand l۪entreprise le souhaite&#187., commentait le directeur du Workers Rights Consortium, une ONG am̩ricaine.Le programme d۪inspection de l۪Accord  qui concerne environ 1700 usines textiles sur les 4500 que compte le Bangladesh[2] a commenc̩ fin 2013. Les dix premiers rapports  qui identifient des probl̬mes importants de s̩curit̩ dans les usines concern̩es  sont disponibles en ligne. En th̩orie, selon les dispositions de l۪Accord, les donneurs d۪ordre s۪engagent  aider leurs fournisseurs  r̩aliser les travaux n̩cessaires,  maintenir des relations d۪affaires avec eux pendant au moins deux ans, mais aussi  r̩mun̩rer les ouvriers et ouvri̬res mis au ch̫mage pendant au moins six mois. Pourtant, en mars dernier, la presse internationale signalait qu۪au moins deux usines avaient ̩t̩ ferm̩es suite aux inspections, dont un fournisseur d۪Auchan employant 3500 ouvri̬res, Softex. Et que les ouvri̬res avaient ̩t̩ cong̩di̩es sans compensation, les patrons de l۪usine se d̩faussant sur Auchan : &#171.Nous fermons des usines  leur demande. Aussi c۪est  eux de financer le ch̫mage des ouvriers.&#187.[3]. Dans sonr̩cent communiqu̩, le groupe fran̤ais reconnąt les faits, mais maintient un silence glac̩ sur le sort r̩serv̩ au fournisseur et aux ouvri̬res. Au vu de la politique martiale affich̩e dans son &#171. plan de lutte contre la sous-traitance sauvage &#187. (voir lepremier volet de cette enqu̻te), ils ont du souci  se faire.Par ailleurs, l۪Accord se concentre sur un probl̬me parmi d۪autres : celui de la s̩curit̩ des usines face aux risques d۪effondrement ou d۪incendie. Sa mise en uvre permettra sans doute d۪̩viter de nouvelles catastrophes de l۪ampleur du Rana Plaza, elle n۪am̩liorera pas en elle-m̻me les horaires de travail des ouvri̬res, leurs salaires, ou leur droit  former des syndicats. Certes, l۪Accord pourrait jouer un r̫le pr̩curseur et se trouver ̩tendu progressivement  d۪autres domaines, d۪autres pays, et d۪autres fili̬res. Certes, les ONG et les syndicats esp̬rent que l۪Accord  dans la mesure o_ il pr̩voit la mise en place de comit̩s de suivi des inspections dans les usines, avec 50% de repr̩sentants des ouvriers  jouera un r̫le catalyseur pour renforcer les droits syndicaux dans les usines. D&#8217.autant plus que parall̬lement, sous la pression de la rue, le gouvernement bangladais a lev̩ les restrictions l̩gales aux libert̩s syndicales jusqu۪alors en vigueur. Mais il est encore bien trop t̫t pour dire si ces espoirs se r̩aliseront, dans un pays qui jusque r̩cemment ̩tait plut̫t r̩put̩ pour sar̩pression des syndicalistes, souvent avec la complicit̩ des autorit̩s politiques.Aucune information n۪est encore disponible sur la mise en place effective de ces comit̩s. Aux dires des syndicalistes bangladais, les progr̬s restent modestes sur le terrain. &#171.Notre moyen d۪action principal reste la manifestation de rue. Ce n۪est pas comme en Europe o_ les travailleurs se r̩unissent dans l۪enceinte m̻me de leur entreprise pour discuter entre eux ou avec la direction.&#187., explique Safia Parvin, une syndicaliste (lire&#171. Depuis la catastrophe du Rana Plaza, les ouvri̬res du textile se sont radicalis̩es. &#187.).  ce jour, seulement 150 usines sur 4500 ont un syndicat officiellement reconnu.De fait, les manifestations ouvri̬res se sont succ̩d̩es depuis la catastrophe du Rana Plaza et jusqu۪ aujourd۪hui. Le gouvernement bangladais alterne entre la r̩pression et les concessions. Il a notamment accept̩ la mise en place d۪une commission pour augmenter le salaire minimal des ouvriers du textile. Celui-ci a ̩t̩ port̩  50 dollars mensuels, contre 28 auparavant  les ouvriers r̩clamaient 100 dollars, et le salaire vital au Bangladesh[4]a ̩t̩ estim̩  260 euros pour le Bangladesh. Certaines entreprises multinationales ont ̩galement annonc̩ des initiatives dans ce domaine : H&amp.M, principal donneur d۪ordre au Bangladesh, a propos̩ de payer directement les ouvriers et de leur assurer un &#171. salaire vital &#187. - au moins, pour commencer, dans quelques usines pilotes. &#171.Nous saluons ces annonces, mais nous n۪avons pas connaissance d۪initiatives concr̬tes  ce stade.&#187.,commenteun autre syndicaliste bangladais.Globalement, donc, le tableau demeure contrast̩. Des propositions novatrices ont ̩t̩ mises sur la table, mais elles restent largement  concr̩tiser. Les entreprises comme H&amp.M ou Carrefour peuvent bien mettre en place des &#171.usines mod̬les&#187.  faire visiter aux journalistes . cela n۪offre aucune garantie quant  l۪̩tat des autres usines. Les fondamentaux du syst̬me n۪ont pas chang̩, et l۪industrie textile bangladaise poursuit imperturbablement son essor : sa part relative et absolue dans le commerce textile mondial a poursuivi sa croissance en 2013 malgr̩ le Rana Plaza, et en d̩pit des menaces de d̩localisation de la production vers d۪autres pays agit̩es par certains dirigeants bangladais. Au vu de la mauvaise volont̩ affich̩e par une grande partie des entreprises, dont les fran̤aises, cela signifie que nous ne sommes pas  encore ?   l۪abri d۪un retour en arri̬re.C۪est que le drame du Rana Plaza  la plus importante catastrophe industrielle de l۪histoire moderne  ne survient pas de mani̬re inattendue. L۪essor rapide de l۪industrie textile bangladaise ne s۪est pas accompagn̩ de la construction de lieux de travail adapt̩s. Les ateliers ont d s۪installer dans des locaux de fortune, souvent avec des issues bloqu̩es, des installations ̩lectriques d̩fectueuses et en l۪absence des mesures de s̩curit̩ les plus ̩l̩mentaires. L۪effondrement du Rana Plaza fait suite  l۪incendie de l۪usine Tazreen, qui avait fait 117 morts en novembre 2012, et avant cela  l۪effondrement de l۪usine Spectrum, en 2005, dans lequel ̩tait d̩j impliqu̩e Carrefour (64 morts). Sans mentionner les centaines d۪accidents mineurs qui surviennent chaque semaine dans les ateliers de confection du pays  aussi bien avant qu۪apr̬s le Rana Plaza[5]. Les ONG avancent le chiffre de 1800 victimes dans des usines textiles au Bangladesh depuis 2005.Au-del encore, on rappellera que l۪industrie textile et les grandes marques comme Nike avaient ̩t̩ cibl̩e d̬s les ann̩es 1980 et 1990 par de grandes campagnes citoyennes aux tats-Unis et en Europe d̩non̤ant les conditions de travail dans les &#171.sweatshops&#187. d۪Asie. En r̩ponse  ces campagnes s۪̩tait mise en place toute une industrie de la &#171. responsabilit̩ sociale des entreprises &#187. (RSE), soutenue par des &#171. codes de conduite &#187. et des &#171. audits sociaux &#187.. Un syst̬me qui n۪a jamais ̩t̩ ni contraignant pour les entreprises ni transparent, et dont le drame historique de 2013 est venu d̩montrer la faillite totale. Il suffit de rappeler qu۪aussi bien l۪usine Tazreen que le Rana Plaza avaient ̩t̩ certifi̩s par des auditeurs quelques semaines  peine avant les accidents. L۪Accord sur la s̩curit̩ des usines a express̩ment ̩t̩ con̤u pour ne pas r̩p̩ter de telles d̩rives[6].Prenons lacatastrophe de l۪usine de Spectrum, en avril 2005, qui offre des parall̬les aussi nombreux que troublants avec celle du Rana Plaza  avec cette diff̩rence non n̩gligeable que l۪immeuble s۪̩tait effondr̩ pendant la nuit, r̩duisant le nombre de victimes. L aussi, la structure de l۪immeuble avait ̩t̩ con̤ue pour cinq ̩tages, mais on en avait ajout̩ quatrea posteriori, sans autorisation. L aussi, les ouvri̬res avaient remarqu̩ des fissures et avaient tent̩, sans succ̬s, d۪alerter leur encadrement. L aussi, elles travaillaient pour de grandes marques europ̩ennes. L aussi, la catastrophe avait entrąn̩ de grandes manifestations ouvri̬res et une mobilisation de la soci̩t̩ civile occidentale. L aussi, les patrons de l۪usines avaient ̩t̩ arr̻t̩s. L aussi, il ̩tait question de lancer un grand programme d۪inspection des usines. Et, l aussi, Carrefour avait refus̩  et refuse encore  ce jour  de participer formellement au fonds d۪indemnisation mis en place pour les victimes du drame.L۪histoire peut-elle se r̩p̩ter ? Derri̬re le refus d۪Auchan et de Carrefour (parmi d۪autres) de contribuer financi̬rement au fonds d۪indemnisation, il y a bien, plus fondamentalement, le refus d۪assumer une responsabilit̩ effective vis--vis des conditions de travail et de vie des ouvri̬res qui travaillent, de fait, pour ces entreprises. En rester au niveau des discours, des r̬gles et des proc̩dures  suivre, tr̬s bien  mais surtout qu۪il ne soit jamais possible de faire un lien quelconque avec la r̩alit̩ v̩cue des gens sur le terrain ! Dans ces conditions, comment ̩viter de retomber dans les travers du pass̩, lorsque les grandes marques faisaient r̩aliser des &#171. audits sociaux &#187. superficiels et annonc̩s  l&#8217.avance dans les usines de leurs fournisseurs, sans rien changer lorsque ces audits constataient des probl̬mes ?D۪o_ l۪importance d۪initiatives telles que la proposition de loi sur le &#171. devoir de vigilance &#187. des entreprises multinationales soumise par un groupe de parlementaires fran̤ais et soutenue par les ONG et les syndicats fran̤ais. Cette loi a pour objectif de responsabiliser les firmes fran̤aises vis--vis des atteintes aux droits humains occasionn̩es par leurs filiales ou leurs sous-traitants  l۪̩tranger, en les obligeant  mettre en place toutes les dispositions raisonnables pour pr̩venir de tels abus. L۪exp̩rience prouve que seule la possibilit̩ pour une entreprise de voir ainsi sa responsabilit̩ juridique mise en cause peut l۪obliger  se confronter  l۪̩preuve des faits. Suite au d̩sastre du Rana Plaza, la ministre au Commerce ext̩rieur d۪alors, Nicole Bricq, a choisi de demander un rapport au &#171. point de contact national &#187. (PCN), une instance abrit̩e par le Minist̬re des finances charg̩e de suivre la mise en uvre des &#171. principes de l۪OCDE sur la responsabilit̩ des entreprises multinationales &#187.[7].Le PCN a produit fin 2013 un rapport plein de bonnes id̩es sur la mątrise et la rationalisation par les firmes fran̤aises de leur chąne d۪approvisionnement et la pr̩vention des &#171. risques &#187., mais notoirement d̩nu̩ de toute mesure contraignante[8]. Et Nicole Bricq en a profit̩,au grand dam des ONGpour ̩carter d۪un revers de main la notion de &#171. devoir de vigilance &#187. (qu۪elle avait tout d۪abord soutenu), en s۪abritant derri̬re la n̩cessit̩ d۪agir  l۪̩chelle europ̩enne.  ce jour, le sort de la proposition de loi  contest̩e par les lobbies patronaux, voire par le gouvernement - parąt bien incertain (lireResponsabilit̩ des entreprises : la gouvernement fran̤ais avance  reculons).La solution viendra-t-elle des tribunaux du Bangladesh ou d۪ailleurs ? Depuis le Rana Plaza, la plupart des patrons des usines concern̩es ont ̩t̩ mis en prison, et des poursuites officielles ont ̩t̩ lanc̩es contre les propri̩taires et les cadres de l۪usine Tazreen. Ces proc̩dures remonteront-elles jusqu۪aux donneurs d۪ordre occidentaux ? La question est  l۪̩tude au Bangladesh et dans plusieurs autres pays.Un pr̩c̩dent souvent invoqu̩  propos du Rana Plaza[9]est celui de l۪incendie de la Triangle Wistshirt Factory, une usine textile situ̩e en plein New York, en 1911. Cette catastrophe industrielle avait fait 146 victimes  des jeunes femmes qui n۪avaient pu sortir de l۪immeuble parce que leurs patrons avaient ferm̩ les portes  cl̩. Le scandale qui s۪en ̩tait suivi avait entrąn̩ la mise en place de r̩gulations pionni̬res visant  am̩liorer la s̩curit̩ des usines et les conditions de travail des ouvriers aux tats-Unis, encore en place aujourd&#8217.hui. L۪un des artisans de ses r̩formes, Frances Perkins, est devenue ensuite secr̩taire d۪tat sous Roosevelt, puis l۪une des fondatrices de l۪Organisation internationale du travail.Au Bangladesh, malgr̩ l۪Accord sur la s̩curit̩ des usines et les autres avanc̩es qui ont suivi le drame du Rana Plaza, on n۪en est pas encore l. Et les grandes entreprises fran̤aises, quoiqu۪elles en disent, sont plut̫t un obstacle sur le chemin.Olivier PetitjeanVoir lepremier volet de cette enqu̻te, qui porte sur le refus d&#8217.entreprises comme Carrefour et Auchan de participer  l&#8217.indemnisation des victimes du Rana Plaza.&mdash.Photo :Zoriah CC[1]Une quinzaine d۪autres marques am̩ricaines s۪y sont associ̩es.

This disaster-the largest l&#8217. modern industrial history-has led to awareness of the international community and forced the multinational sector to take new commitments to improve working conditions in the factories of their suppliers. But the advanced (real) obtained since the tragedy remain to achieve, including the legal level. Second part of our investigation into the Rana Plaza.Lerefus groups such as Carrefour or Auchande engage formally in the approach to compensation victims of Rana Plaza unfortunate reflects a more general nervousness. If firms that both have made several hundred million d&#8217 .euros profits in 2013 refuse to contribute, even symbolically, funds d&#8217. compensation for victims who s&#8217. is not more than US$ 40 million in all, how hope for real change in the reports of force economic and political l&#8217. global textile industry? Such an attitude can only pose to effective implementation of the Agreement on the safety of plants, signed by more than 150 Western brands in the wake of the disaster, and represents in the eyes of many l&#8217. legacy more positive.And of course, the signing of l&#8217. Agreement represents a significant step forward for d&#8217. ensure effective multinational companies responsibility towards their supply chain-a goal which had remained out of reach despite decades of rhetoric about sustainable development and &#171. corporate societal &#187. (CSR). For the first time, thanks to pressure public opinion and the international community, the signatory companies engaged in a process independent and binding inspection and implementation standards plants their suppliers. The Agreement provides a total transparency on plants visited, the result of inspections and monitoring of work to achieve (but not, significantly, on donors who supply orders). Funding for the operation will be provided by businesses, in proportion to the volume of production outsourced to Bangladesh. The potential disputes will be decided by the justice of the country of origin of firms, under the New York Convention for the arbitration of international trade disputes.That is precisely the reason alleged by Gap and Walmart for not having signed the Agreement, which would pave the way, they said, in the US judicial context, a responsibility &#171. unlimited &#187. donors orders. The American economic lobbies have faitpubliquement campagnecontre the Agreement, and Gap and Walmart finally establish top-level process parallel, less binding and without participation of workers to inspections [ 1 ]. &#171. This Gap request is the right to return to its commitments when the company souhaite&#187., said the director of the Workers Rights Consortium, an American NGO.The programme Inspection Agreement to approximately 1700 4500 textile mills in Bangladesh [ 2 ]-started late 2013. The first ten reports-which identify important issues of security in the factories concerned-are available online. In theory, according to the provisions of the Agreement, donors and undertake to help their suppliers to achieve the necessary work, maintain business relationships with them for at least two years, but also to pay workers and workers being unemployed for at least six months. Yet, last March, the international press reported that at least two plants had been closed following inspections, Auchan provider employing 3500 workers, Softex. And that workers had been dismissed without compensation, patterns of the plant on them Auchan: &#171. We are closing plants in their request. So it is up to them to fund unemployment workers. &#187. [ 3 ]. In sonr̩cent statement, the French group recognizes the facts, but maintains a frozen silence on the fate of the supplier and the workers. In view of the martial policy displayed in its &#171. plan to combat outsourcing wild &#187. (see the first part of this investigation), they have to worry about.In addition, the Agreement focuses on a problem among others: that of the safety of plants at risk of collapse or fire. Its implementation will probably avoid new disasters of the magnitude of the Rana Plaza, it will not itself working hours of workers, their salaries, or their right to form trade unions. Of course, the Agreement could play a pioneering role and be extended gradually to other areas, other countries, and other channels. Of course, NGOs and trade unions hope the Agreement to the extent that it provides for the establishment of monitoring committees inspections in factories, with 50% of representatives of workers-will play a catalytic role to strengthen union rights in factories. D &#8217. as parallel, under pressure from the street, the Bangladesh government has lifted the legal restrictions on trade union freedoms until then in force. But it is still far too early to say whether these hopes are realized, in a country that until recently was rather known for sar̩pression trade unionists, often with the complicity of political authorities.No information is still available on the effective implementation of these committees. According to Bangladeshi trade unionists, progress remains modest on the ground. &#171. Our means of action remains the main street demonstration. This is not like in Europe where workers meet in the same business forum to discuss among themselves or with management. &#187., Safia said Parvin, a unionist (lire&#171. Since the Rana Plaza disaster, the textile workers were radicalized. &#187.). To date, only 150 of the 4500 plants a union officially recognized.In fact, the labour protests have followed since the disaster of Rana Plaza and until today. The Bangladesh government alternates between repression and concessions. In particular, he accepted the establishment of a commission to increase the minimum wage of textile workers. It has been increased to 50 dollars monthly, compared to 28 previously-workers demanding 100 dollars, and the salary vital in Bangladesh [ 4 ] was estimated at 260 euros for Bangladesh. Some multinational companies have also announced initiatives in this area: H &amp. M, the main originator in Bangladesh, has proposed to pay directly workers and to ensure a &#171. vital salary &#187.-at least, to begin, in a few pilot plants. &#171. We welcome these announcements, but we have no knowledge of concrete initiatives to this stage. &#187., commenteun other Bangladeshi trade unionist.Overall, therefore, the picture remains mixed. Innovative proposals were put on the table, but they remain largely to achieve. Companies like H &amp. M or Carrefour may well establish &#171. plants mod̬les&#187. to make visit to journalists. it offers no guarantee as to the state of other plants. The basic system have not changed, and the Bangladesh textile industry continues on its growth: its relative share and absolute in the global textile trade continued to grow in 2013 despite the Rana Plaza, and despite threats of relocation of production to other countries agitated by some leaders of Bangladesh. Given the unwillingness displayed by a large part of companies, including French, it means that we are not-yet? -from back.It is that the tragedy of Rana Plaza-the largest industrial disaster in modern history-not occurs unexpectedly. The rapid expansion of the Bangladesh textile industry is not accompanied by the construction of places of work adapted. The workshops have had to install in local property, often with exits blocked, faulty electrical installations and in the absence of security measures the most basic. The collapse of the Rana Plaza following the fire in the plant Tazreen, which killed 117 people in November 2012, and before that the collapse of the plant Spectrum, in 2005, in which was already involved Carrefour (64 dead). Without mentioning the hundreds of minor accidents that occur each week in the workshops making the country-both before and after the Rana Plaza [ 5 ]. NGOs say the figure of 1800 victims in textile factories in Bangladesh since 2005.Beyond again, recalled that the textile industry and major brands such as Nike had been targeted as early as the 1980 and 1990 by large civic campaigns in the United States and Europe denouncing the working conditions in the &#171. sweatshops&#187. Asia. In response to these campaigns had established a industry &#171. corporate social responsibility &#187. (CSR), supported by &#171. codes of conduct &#187. and &#171. social audits &#187.. A system that has never been nor binding on companies or transparent, and whose historical drama of 2013 came to demonstrate total bankruptcy. Just remember that both the plant Tazreen that the Rana Plaza had been certified by auditors just a few weeks before the accident. The Agreement on the safety of plants has specifically been designed to not repeat such excesses [ 6 ].Let lacatastrophe plant Spectrum, in April 2005, which provides as many disturbing parallels with the Rana Plaza-with this difference significant that the building had collapsed during the night, reducing the number of victims. Again, the structure of the building was designed to five floors, but it was added quatrea post, without authorization. Again, workers had noticed cracks and had tried, without success, to alert their coaching. Again, they worked for large European brands. Again, the disaster had led to large protests workers and mobilization of civil society Western. Again, patterns of plants had been arrested. Again, it was question of launching a major inspection program factories. And, again, Carrefour had refused-and still refuses to date-to participate formally in the compensation fund established for the victims of the tragedy.Can history repeat? Behind the refusal to Auchan and Carrefour (among others) contribute financially to the compensation fund, well, more fundamentally, the refusal to assume effective responsibility towards the working conditions and living workers working, in effect, for these companies. In remain at the speech, rules and procedures to follow, very well-but above all it is never possible to any link with the reality experienced people on the ground! In these conditions, how to avoid relapsing into through the past, when the major brands were making &#171. social audits &#187. superficial and announced to l&#8217. plants advance their suppliers, without anything change when these audits found problems?Hence the importance of initiatives such as the proposed law on the &#171. duty of vigilance &#187. multinational companies submitted by a group of French parliamentarians and supported by NGOs and unions French. The law aims to empower French firms in relation to human rights abuses caused by their subsidiaries or their subcontractors abroad, by forcing them to implement all reasonable provisions to prevent such abuses. Experience shows that only the possibility for a company see and legal responsibility in question can force them to confront the facts. Following the disaster of Rana Plaza, Commerce Minister outside then, Nicole Bricq had, has chosen to ask a report to &#171. national contact point &#187.

And Nicole Bricq had benefited, much to the chagrin of ONGpour from a setback tomorrow the concept of &#171. duty of vigilance &#187. (she had first submitted), hiding behind the need to act on a European scale. To date, the fate of the bill-challenged by the employer lobbies, even by the government-seems uncertain (lireResponsabilit̩ business: the French government is backwards).The solution will courts of Bangladesh or elsewhere? Since the Rana Plaza, most bosses factories concerned were put in prison, and official proceedings have been launched against the owners and managers of the plant Tazreen. These procedures will they to order Western donors? The question is under consideration in Bangladesh and several other countries.A previous often invoked in connection with the Rana Plaza [ 9 ] is that of the burning of the Triangle Wistshirt Factory, a textile factory located in full New York, in 1911.

Si la gauche dans son ensemble s۪est prononc̩e en faveur du texte, la droite s۪y est oppos̩e au nom de &#171. la comp̩titivit̩ &#187. des entreprises. Ce texte est pourtant cens̩ apporter une r̩ponse  des catastrophes comme celles du Rana Plaza au Bangladesh, ou  de futurs drames sociaux et pollutions environnementales dans lesquels seraient impliqu̩es des grandes entreprises fran̤aises.Le texte de loi sur les &#171. soci̩t̩s m̬res et entreprises donneuses d۪ordre &#187. a ̩t̩ vot̩ par l&#8217.Assembl̩e nationale dans la soir̩e du 30 mars. Il instaure un &#171. devoir de vigilance &#187. pour les grandes entreprises multinationales vis--vis de leurs sous-traitants, en France comme  l۪̩tranger, en mati̬re sociale comme environnementale.Cette loi est&#171. l۪aboutissement d۪un gros travail commun entre associations, syndicats et ̩lus &#187., rappelle Nayla Ajaltouni, duCollectif de l۪̩thique sur l۪̩tiquette. A l۪Assembl̩e, trois d̩put̩s se sont particuli̬rement investis dans la r̩daction du texte : Danielle Auroi, d̩put̩e ̩cologiste du Puy-de-D̫me, Dominique Potier, d̩put̩ socialiste de Meurthe-et-Moselle et Philippe Nogues, d̩put̩ socialiste du Morbihan. Mais la faible participation en s̩ance  environ 25 d̩put̩s sur 577 &#171. n۪envoie pas un signal tr̬s positif aux citoyens &#187., observe Nayla Ajaltouni.Face  des drames comme celui du Rana Plaza, au Bangladesh, cette loi constitue pourtant&#171. un d̩but de r̩ponse &#187., selon son rapporteur, Dominique Potier (lirenotre entretien). Le 24 avril 2013, cet immeuble d۪une banlieue industrielle de Dacca, abritant des ateliers textiles, s۪effondrent, provoquant la mort de 1138 personnes, en majorit̩ des ouvri̬res, et plus de 2000 bless̩s. Les employ̩s y confectionnaient des v̻tements pour des grandes marques occidentales. Un fonds d۪indemnisation des victimes et de leurs familles a bien ̩t̩ cr̩̩ sous l۪̩gide de l۪Organisation internationale du travail (OIT). Mais les entreprises concern̩es par le drame y abondent de mani̬re volontaire, selon leurs propres crit̬res, et sans obligation de divulguer les montants.A ce jour, seuls 21 millions de dollars ont ̩t̩ vers̩s sur les 30 millions n̩cessaires  une&#171. indemnisation juste et compl̬te &#187.des victimes et de leurs familles. Gap et Walmart ont contribu̩ ensemble  hauteur de 2,2 millions de dollars, la marque irlandaise Primark pour un million et l۪allemand C&amp.A pour 690 000 dollars. C̫t̩ fran̤ais, le groupe Auchan a sign̩ un ch̬que d۪1,5 million de dollars, Camaeu n۪a pas souhait̩ divulguer le montant de sa contribution  comme la majorit̩ des marques concern̩es  et Carrefour refuse toujours d۪y abonder[1]. La lenteur du processus etles tergiversationsdes grandes entreprises ont des effets plus que douloureux au Bangladesh : deux ans plus tard, des centaines de victimes attendent encore d۪̻tre indemnis̩es.C۪est le cas de Yonour (en photo), une adolescente de 15 ans  l۪̩poque, qui travaillait avec sa m̬re au sein d۪un atelier textile du Rana Plaza. Sa m̬re est morte sous les d̩combres, Yonour a perdu partiellement l۪usage de ses jambes. Depuis l&#8217.effondrement, elle est hospitalis̩e dans un centre de r̩habilitation pour paralys̩s, financ̩ par la Croix Rouge,  quelques centaines de m̬tres du lieu du drame.&#171. En tant qu۪ąn̩e de la famille, Yonour se sacrifiait pour que ses fr̬res et surs aillent  l۪̩cole. Il y a encore quelques mois, elle ne percevait absolument aucune indemnisation &#187., t̩moigne Anne Gintzburger, qui l۪avait rencontr̩e lors de la r̩alisation de son documentaire&#171. Les damn̩s du low cost &#187..La loi qui vient d۪̻tre adopt̩e devrait mettre fin  cette impunit̩, et ̩viter que de tels drames humains ne se reproduisent, en tout cas l o_ des entreprises fran̤aises sont impliqu̩es. Elle oblige les entreprises  mettre en uvre un &#171. plan de vigilance &#187. cens̩ pr̩venir les risques d۪atteintes aux droits humains,  la sant̩ des travailleurs,  l۪environnement, ainsi que &#171. les comportements de corruption &#187.. Ce plan de vigilance concerne les activit̩s de leurs filiales ainsi que leurs sous-traitants et fournisseurs. En cas de probl̬mes graves dans leurs chąnes de sous-traitance, la justice fran̤aise pourra donc ̻tre saisie.S۪il est d̩montr̩ que l۪entreprise a failli dans son devoir de vigilance, elle risque une amende de dix millions d۪euros.&#171. La loi ouvre aussi la possibilit̩ aux victimes d۪obtenir r̩paration &#187., pr̩cise Nayla Ajaltouni.&#171. Mais ce sera, pour elles, un parcours du combattant. &#187.Il incombera aux victimes de d̩montrer que l۪entreprise n۪a pas mis en uvre les moyens n̩cessaires pour ̩viter un drame, et non  l۪entreprise de prouver qu۪elle a tout fait pour l۪̩viter.Car la loi a ̩t̩ ̩dulcor̩e. La premi̬re version, d̩battue le 29 janvier, a ̩t̩ renvoy̩e en commission suite  l۪hostilit̩ du gouvernement, sensible au lobbying du Medef et de l۪Association fran̤aise des entreprises priv̩es (Afep), qui d̩fend les int̩r̻ts des grands groupes. _tre soumis  un minimum d۪obligations en mati̬re de responsabilit̩ sociale et environnementale n۪est pas du got des grands patrons :&#171. Nous avons tr̬s peur que cette proposition de loi d̩bouche de nouveau sur des contraintes impos̩es  des soci̩t̩s fran̤aises &#187., a critiqu̩ Pierre Gattaz, pr̩sident du Medef, le 17 mars.&#171. Cette loi ne met en uvre que ce que les entreprises du CAC 40 proclament d̩j. Si elles sont autant vertueuses qu۪elles le disent, cela ne devrait pas les mettre en danger &#187., r̩pond Nayla Ajaltouni.La version &#171. light &#187. du devoir de vigilance ne s۪appliquera qu۪aux entreprises qui comptent plus de 5 000 salari̩s en France, ou 10 000  l۪̩tranger. Le secteur du textile n۪est pas le seul concern̩. Vinci, avec ses filiales au Qataraccus̩esde recourir  des formes de travail indigne, ou Total, pourses activit̩s polluantes au Nigeria, y seront ̩galement soumis. Mais ce crit̬re d۪effectif permet au p̩trolier Perenco,mis en causeen Amazonie et en Afrique, ou  l۪entreprise textile Camaeu, dont des sous-traitants ̩taient pr̩sents au Rana Plaza, d۪̩chapper  ce &#171. devoir de vigilance &#187..Le 30 mars, le texte a ̩t̩ vot̩ gr̢ce  l۪ensemble de la gauche.&#171.  l۪heure actuelle, les entreprises fran̤aises sont l̩galement responsables vis--vis de leurs salari̩s, mais pas vis--vis de ceux qui travaillent pour leurs sous-traitants. Certaines entreprises ont certes adopt̩ des codes de bonne conduite, des chartes ̩thiques, mais nous savons que cela reste tr̬s insuffisant pour lutter efficacement contre cedumpingsocial et environnemental de grande ampleur &#187., a fait valoir Andr̩ Chassaigne, d̩put̩ Front de gauche du Puy-de-D̫me. L۪argument n۪a pas convaincu l۪UMP ni les centristes de l۪UDI qui ont vot̩ contre[2].&#171. Toutes ces incertitudes nous font craindre des effets particuli̬rement n̩fastes pour la comp̩titivit̩ des entreprises fran̤aises &#187., a critiqu̩ Jean-Marie Tetart, d̩put̩ UMP des Yvelines (lirele compte-rendu des d̩bats).Pour Arnaud Richard, d̩put̩ UDI (̩galement des Yvelines),&#171. cette proposition de loi trahit l۪esprit de la RSE[Responsabilit̩ sociale des entreprises, ndlr], fond̩ sur la prise de responsabilit̩, l۪initiative et la d̩marche volontaire, qui ont d̩j fait leurs preuves. Plut̫t que de contraindre les entreprises vis̩es par le texte  mettre en place un plan de vigilance, ce sont pr̩cis̩ment les d̩marches volontaires que nous devrions encourager. &#187.Ces d̩marches volontaires ont pourtant clairement ̩chou̩ dans le cadre de l&#8217.effondrement du Rana Plaza, et  l&#8217.aune de la longue liste d&#8217.incendies et d&#8217.accidents qui endeuillent l&#8217.industrie textile asiatique.M̻me ̩dulcor̩, le texte est salu̩ par les organisations non gouvernementales comme&#171. un premier pas historique &#187..&#171. Pour la premi̬re fois la responsabilit̩ des multinationales est reconnue &#187., plaide Juliette Renaud, des Amis de la terre. Reste que cette ̩tape initiale n۪est pas encore v̩ritablement franchie. La loi doit suivre son chemin parlementaire et passer devant le S̩nat, en majorit̩  droite, avant de revenir  l۪Assembl̩e. Sa mise en uvre sera ensuite soumise  des d̩crets d۪application.&#171. Elle risque encore d۪̻tre affaiblie &#187., s۪inqui̬te Juliette Renaud. La rapidit̩ de son parcours parlementaire et les d̩crets qui s۪ensuivront montreront le niveau d۪engagement du gouvernement et du ministre de l۪conomie et de Finances, Emmanuel Macron, sur ce sujet. Ou mettra en lumi̬re l۪ampleur de leur indiff̩rence pour les oubli̩s de la mondialisation.Ivan du Roy (@IvanduRoysur twitter)Photo : Chasseur d&#8217.̩toiles[1][2];"Duty of vigilance of multinationals: civil society welcomes &#171. a first historic step &#187. Social Responsibility Act establishing a &#171. duty of vigilance &#187. for multinational French social and environmental, was finally passed on March 30. If the left as a whole voted in favour of the text, the right objected on behalf of &#171. the competitiveness &#187. businesses. This text is yet to make a response to disasters such as the Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, or future tragedies social and environmental pollution which would be involved in major French companies.The legislation on &#171. parent companies and businesses donors order &#187. has been voted by l&#8217. National Assembly in the evening of March 30. It introduces a &#171. duty of vigilance &#187. for large multinational companies with their subcontractors, France and abroad, social and environmental.The law est&#171. the culmination of a large joint work between associations, unions and elected &#187., recalls Nayla Ajaltouni, duCollectif ethics on the label. At the Assembly, three members particularly invested in the drafting of the text: Danielle Auroi, M.P. ecologist Puy-de-Dome, Dominique Potier, Socialist member of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Philippe Nogues, Socialist member of Morbihan. But the low participation in meeting-approximately 25 members on 577-&#171. not sends a very positive signal to citizens &#187., observes Nayla Ajaltouni.Faced with tragedies such as the Rana Plaza, Bangladesh, this law is pourtant&#171. a response early &#187., according to its rapporteur, Dominique Potier (lirenotre maintenance). On April 24, 2013, this building an industrial suburb of Dhaka, where textile workshops, collapse, causing the death of 1138 people, majority of workers, and more than 2000 injured. Employees are sewed clothing for major Western brands. A compensation fund for victims and their families has been created under the auspices of the International Labour Organization (ILO). But the undertakings concerned by the tragedy there abound a voluntary, according to their own criteria, and without obligation to disclose the amounts.To date, only 21 million dollars have been paid on 30 million needed to une&#171. compensation just and comprehensive &#187. victims and their families. Gap and Walmart have helped set in the amount of 2.2 million, the Irish Primark brand for a million and German C &amp. A for 690 000 dollars. C̫t̩, French group Auchan has signed a cheque for 1, 5 million, Vons declined to disclose the amount of its contribution-as the majority of marks concerned-and Carrefour still refuses to agree there [ 1 ]. The slow process and tergiversationsdes large companies have effects more than painful in Bangladesh: two years later, hundreds of victims still waiting to be compensated.This is the case of Yonour (photo), a 15-year-old girl at the time, who worked with his mother in a textile workshop of Rana Plaza. His mother died under the rubble, Yonour has partially lost the use of his legs. Since l&#8217 .effondrement, it is hospitalized in a rehabilitation centre for paralyzed, funded by the Red Cross, a few hundred metres from the site of the tragedy. &#171. As the eldest of the family, Yonour is sacrificed for his brothers and sisters go to school. There are still a few months, it was absolutely no compensation &#187., is Anne Gintzburger, who had encountered during the implementation of its documentaire&#171. The damned low cost &#187..The law just adopted should end this impunity, and prevent such human tragedies in the future, in any case where French companies are involved. It requires companies to implement a &#171. vigilance plan &#187. supposed to prevent risk of human rights violations, health workers, the environment, as well as &#171. behaviour of corruption &#187.. This plan vigilance with respect to activities of their subsidiaries and their subcontractors and suppliers. In case of serious problems in their strings of subcontracting, French justice may therefore be entered.If it is shown that the company has failed in its duty of vigilance, it may a fine of ten million euros. &#171. The law also opens the opportunity for victims to obtain reparation &#187., said Nayal Ajaltouni. &# 171. But it will be, for them, an obstacle course. &#187. It will be the victims to demonstrate that the company did not implemented the means necessary to avoid a tragedy, and not to the company to prove that it has done everything to avoid.Because the law was watered down. The first version, debated on January 29, was returned to the committee following the hostility of the government, sensitive to the lobbying of Medef and French Association of private companies (Afep), which defends the interests of major groups. Be subject to a minimum of obligations to social and environmental responsibility is not the taste of major patterns: &#171. We have very afraid this bill leads again constraints imposed on French companies &#187., criticized Pierre group, chairman of the MEDEF, March 17. &#171. This law implements what the CAC 40 companies already proclaim. If they are so righteous that they say, it should not endanger &#187., meets Nayal Ajaltouni.&#171. light &#187. the duty of vigilance will only apply to companies that have more than 5 000 employees in France, or 10 000 abroad. The textile sector is not the only concerned. Vinci, with its subsidiaries in Qataraccus̩esde use forms of work unworthy, or Total, pourses polluting activities in Nigeria, will also submitted. But this criterion of strength allows the oil Perenco, implemented causeen the Amazon and Africa, or textile company cameo, including subcontractors were present at the Rana Plaza, escape this &#171. duty of vigilance &#187..On March 30, the text has been voted through the entire left. &#171. Currently, French firms are legally responsible towards their employees, but not towards those who work for their subcontractors. Some companies have certainly adopted codes of conduct, charters ethical, but we know that it remains very insufficient to effectively combat cedumpingsocial and environmental large-scale &#187., said Andr̩ Chassaigne, Member Front left Puy-de-D̫me. The argument has not convinced the UMP or the centrist IDU who voted against [ 2 ]. &#171. All these uncertainties we are fear of adverse effects particularly on the competitiveness of French companies &#187., criticized Jean-Marie Tetart, UMP member of Yvelines (lirele account of debates).For Arnaud Richard, hon IDU (also Yvelines), &# 171. this proposed bill betrays the spirit of the CSR [ corporate social responsibility, "" ], based on the decision-making responsibility, initiative and the voluntary approach, which have already proven. Rather than forcing companies covered by the text to establish a plan of vigilance, it is precisely the voluntary approaches that we should encourage. &#187. These voluntary approaches yet have clearly failed in the framework of l&#8217 .effondrement of Rana Plaza, and l&#8217. by the long list d&#8217. fires and d&#8217. accidents that beset l&#8217. Asian textile industry.Even watered down, the text is welcomed by non-governmental organizations comme&#171. a first historic step &#187.. &#171. For the first time the responsibility of multinationals is recognized &#187., advocates Juliette Renaud, Friends of the Earth. But this initial stage is not yet really taken. The law must take its parliamentary path and go before the Senate, most on the right, before returning to the Assembly. Its implementation will be then submitted to implementing decrees. &#171. It may still be weakened &#187., about Juliette Renaud. The speed of the parliamentary route and decrees that follow will be the level of commitment of the government and the Minister of Economy and Finance, Emmanuel Macron, on this subject. Or will highlight the extent of their disregard for the forgotten of globalization.Ivan Roy (@IvanduRoysur twitter) Photo: Chasseur d&#8217. stars [ 1 ] [ 2 ]"

Europe&#8217.s future is high efficiency and low-carbon, and to get there we need to embrace the right policies now &#8211. including a higher target for emissions cuts.Today 72 major businesses sent a letter to politicians to tell them this.The noisy few from carbon-intensive sectors like steel and cement, who talk up the risks of action and ignore the benefits, seem ever more isolated.Here&#8217.s the WWF press release:Today 72 leading businesses came out openly in support of a credible European climate policy framework, backing a joint initiative by the Climate Group, the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership and WWF. The companies call on the EU to adopt a 30% emissions reduction target by 2020 below 1990 levels, to preserve the European Union۪s competitiveness, and build a low-carbon economy.Together, the signatories of the call account for more than 3.8 million employees with an annual turnover of more than 1 trillion, a sum superior to the combined GDPs of Poland, Sweden and Austria. The companies all agree that the many benefits of a swift transition to the low-carbon economy outweigh the costs of emissions reductions.Tony Long, Director, WWF European Policy Office said: &#8220.All of these companies demonstrate that business rationales on climate are evolving &#8211. a stronger policy framework is in their interest because of the investments and opportunities it can unlock. Retaining an EU 20% target would simply perpetuate a cycle of low ambition that will inevitably lead to dangerous climate change. Given the 30% target is a no-regrets position for Europe economically, it is logical to move to it now.&#8221.The following businesses have explicitly supported this Declaration so far:Acciona, Adolfo Dominguez, Allianz, Alpro, Arjowiggins graphic, Arkadin, ASDA, Atkins, Aviva, Aviva Investors, Barilla, Better Place, BNP Paribas, Boralex, BSH Bosch Siemens Hausgeraete, British Telecom, BSkyB, Capgemini, Carrefour, Centrica, Climate Change Capital, Coca-Cola Enterprises, The Coca-Cola  Company, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Cr̩dit Agricole, Danfoss, Danone, DHV Group, DONG Energy, Electrolux, Elopak, Eneco, Eurostar, F&#038.C Asset Management, Ferrero, First Solar, Google, H&#038.M, If P&#038.C Insurance Company Ltd, IKEA, InterfaceFLOR, John Lewis Partnership, Johnson Controls Inc, Kingfisher, Lafuma, Mango, Marks and Spencer, National Grid, Nestl̩, Nike, Nokia Siemens Networks, Novo Nordisk, Philips, PUMA, Rockwool, RSA, Scottish and Southern Energy, SKAI Group of Companies, Sony Europe, Standard Life, Sveaskog, Swiss Re, Thames Water, The Co-operative Group, Tryg, Unicredit, Unilever, United Biscuits, Velux, Vestas, Vodafone, WSP Group.[Go to WWF webpage](http://www.wwf.eu/?200650/72-leading-companies-call-for-increase-in-EU-climate-ambition-to-boost-EU-economy-and-jobs &#8220.WWF press release&#8221.)Michael BuickJun 15, 2011TweetTweetTweetTweetShareShareShareShareShareShareShareShareStumbleStumbleStumbleStumblePinPinPinPin+1+1+1+1;

597a0792d848472c164d1ca9;R1901;HS;"CommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantNorth Korea is the most isolated and closed-off country in the world. Basic freedoms -- such as the freedom of speech, press, non-governmental markets, religion, association, and movement -- are denied the North Koreans, causing an estimated 300,000 North Koreans to cross the border into China to escape starvation, unemployment, and political oppression. If caught, these refugees are sent back to North Korea, where they face imprisonment or execution for leaving their country (an ""infraction"" that is considered treason). To prevent capture, North Korean refugees either remain in hiding in China or escape again to Southeast Asia, a region known for friendlier nations that allow North Koreans to apply for refugee status.As an intern at the nonprofit advocacy organization, Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), I met a family of North Korean refugees. Peter* and his wife Gloria* were protected in one of LiNK's shelters for North Korean refugees in Southeast Asia for more than one year, while waiting to be processed for resettlement to the United States. In the summer of 2008, Peter and Gloria arrived in the United States. A year later, they invited LiNK members to their apartment for a visit, and to meet their newborn daughter Jennie*. I went with my other intern teammates, Pedro Lopez and Julie Woodruff, to meet with Peter and Gloria.We all hunched over Jennie's bed holding our breath each time she opened her eyes. As the child of two North Korean refugees, Jennie is one of few North Korean babies to be born in America. Unlike her parents, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of movement are all granted to her as a birthright.""Your baby is a U.S. citizen,"" we whispered. Gloria nodded and smiled. She looked down at the baby and smoothed her black hair with two fingers. ""We are very happy,"" she answered.Gloria, her husband Peter, and Jennie live in a guest room at a friend's home. Nearly three years ago, Gloria and Peter escaped from North Korea. With LiNK's assistance, they reached safety and are now resettled in the United States.The guest room they live in is sparsely furnished. Most of the room's space is taken by the large bed where Jennie sleeps in the middle, framed as the most prized thing in the room. Gloria motioned for us to sit on the floor as she served us a plate of fruit.We ate and chatted with Gloria about Jennie and her pregnancy while my teammate Pedro snapped photos of the baby to share with friends back at the LiNK office. I noticed a Korean-English Bible on the floor beside us. In North Korea, possessing a Bible is grounds for lifetime imprisonment.As it came time for us to leave, Gloria said she wanted to view the pictures on Pedro's camera. She asked him to delete the ones showing her face: ""We still have family in North Korea."" Peter's brother, she explained, just got out of a prison camp. He was arrested because of their escape. In North Korea, relatives of defectors are punished. Even if a North Korean is safely resettled in a free country, she must be careful that there is no evidence of her escape on the internet or news that the government can use to reprimand her family. Gloria and Peter want to bring their family out of North Korea.We thanked Gloria and huddled around Jennie one last time. Gloria unzipped the baby's blanket pouch, revealing a tiny body that stretched and wriggled. Jennie, whose parents were born into a horrific condition, was born into great freedom. Jennie is a seed of hope for the 23 million in North Korea.Chelsea Marcumis a former intern for Liberty in North Korea. LiNK hopes to launch a transition home called ""Liberty House"" to further assist refugees like Peter, Gloria, and Jennie.

With regard to the first ranking that we published in 2013, nuestrosegundo ranked at̼nhan dropped four brands, which are also all queue.  And the last repeated position. Want to know why ?  Here we have. If we find ourselves down by aOrtiz.Puede surprise that the brand red sailboat with the same color appears as if something is known for its beautiful advertising and tuna fish cane ""one by one,"" i.e. be sustainable.  But not be sustainable must be transparent, and that is the black point of Ortiz.En 2013 does not want to meet with us or provide informaci_n.Algo have come, we have already met and something we have been, but have not provided all the information necessary to evaluate as if they have other companies.  Are they sustainable ?  They said yes but we have not been able to check their cans and not put enough information. In last place we aEroski.Quieren improve their sustainability but their commitments and their current situation are well below other brands. A simple point to begin work would report more to the consumer. In their cans and, while they are a vendor, in other platforms that can reach the consumer and brochures, etc... We Albo billboard.  Only sell nice (all cane, very positive) and clear tuna (or yellowfin).  The latter has some populations in poor condition so if you wait for a sustainable fishing would have much less impact, but much of that tuna fishing is not sustainable as the siege with SDF.  But it seems not yet feel the pressure to improve in this aspect.  Nor in consumer information.  Their cans do not indicate fishing zone or method. The following we are esCalvo, probably one of the most well-known brands of tuna.  Although 2013 seems going to improve much finally seems to have stalled and have developed other brands.  You have increased their offer tuna from selective fishing gear on the previous ranking.  You have a clear tuna product with cane and beautiful but there are.  The rest comes from fishing closure in many cases with SDF.  As the label also does not indicate anything, beyond that it is tuna, because it is not easy to make consumers.  With their own ships part of its tuna fish have much potential to improve and invest more sustainable fisheries. And we finish our tour of the queue conCarrefour.Han dropped nothing more and nothing less than from the second place to 10th.  They have a lot of potential for improvement as they have a centralized policy is good and that bid to improve.  But it seems that in some countries more than in others and, while such ennuestro ranking of Franciase have been a step in the podium, here have been more lazy.  Van to launch a product of fishing with cane 2016, the same as in other countries, but there is a commitment.  Not going to bet on more sustainable fishing closure such as France.  Like other brands of the queue, its labelling leaves much to be desired, but at least indicate the capture area.  The method of fishing only appear in its new product.  And, as we have said conEroski, a vendor have the ability to inform the consumer more other tools such as brochures, billboard etc... as other supermarkets are already doing.   We at least give a step in this simple point of improvement. And after this review, what do you think ? We believe that these brands should improve, so buying tuna can both defend the oceans. If you seem a good idea that you only make a simple gesture: DISELO ! Signing this petition for these brands have more sustainable tuna and their labels have a clear information.

France adopted a logo for the consumer, when it fact its races, to know and compare at a glance the nutritional quality of food products. The Interdepartmental stopped recommending the NutriScore information system as nutritional officiela effect was signed on October 31. But some industrial refuse still use this labelling.The f̩d̩rationAlliance 7regroupant manufacturers for breakfast cereals, candy or cookies and campaign leads to members to encourage them to opt for a different logo, said the association of consumers UFC That Choose, document support. This position is in line with that of six multinational, Mars, Mondelez, Nestle, Coca-Cola, Unilever and PepsiCo-nicknamed the ""Big 6""-which, from the month of March, had announced to develop across European unlogo alternative. Several are also members of Alliance 7. In his ""manifesto"", the union professional is ""to help the consumer to make food choices informed"". But some elements could inform this strategy under another day.We wanted to know the nutritional score obtained, on the basis of the official logo, products manufacturers ""Big 6"". The results, detailed below, show that the majority are rather poorly classified in the scale NutriScore. And suggest that the efforts of some industrialists to install a logo designed alternative, contrary to the assertions of Alliance 7, to create confusion in the minds of consumers about the nutritional value of their actual food.Let us, briefly, on the long political process that has led to the adoption of the NutriScore system, developed by our research team at the University Paris 13. The previous Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, has the proposal for a logo of nutrition information on foundations of unrapportqui was issued in 2014. This principle of labelling not mandatory but voluntary, was incorporated into the law of modernization of the system sant̩vot̩een December 2016. The decree application was published in July 2016 without being said, at this stage, the graphical format logo.It is based, inter alia, on a ̩tudegrandeur naturemen̩e in 60 stores the request of industrial agri-food and distributors, Marisol Touraine announced in March 2017, the choice of NutriScore among several logos. choice confirmed by the Minister of Health present, Agnes Buzyn, one of the three signatories to the arrested with the Ministers of Agriculture and Economy.The NutriScore, which has 5 colors, is intended to inform consumers about the nutritional quality of foods and allow them to compare them. This choice was made by the government on the basis detr̬s many ̩tudespubli̩es in international scientific journals. It is this approach based on the evidence that led the office Europe World in welcome initiative, in March, and to welcome the fact that ""France has very largely based its decision on the evidence available in this regard"".Indeed, all work carried out in the framework of the dialogue launched in 2015 on the subject, or independently by research teams public Insem, INRA, and various universities, showed the superiority of NutriScore over other MSDS tested. Studies have focused both on laperceptiondes different logos by consumers, lacompr̩hension objectiveet their impact on the nutritional quality of food purchases measured either in unsupermarch̩ experimental,  real stores. The results of this work are convergent and show a higher efficiency of NutriScore, both for the general population for population groups most disadvantaged and subjects with chronic diseases such as diabetes.Despite these scientific evidence, and contrary to the positions of consumer associations calling for the NutriScore, several food lobbies oppose this logo, since the emergence of the proposal. They use including a simple process, which has proven in other economic sectors such as tobacco. Failure to successfully block a political decision, industrial cladding of an alternative system potentially less penalizing for their interests, justifying its interest ... for consumers!So the Big 6 industrial they have proposed to use the NutriCouleurs, a graphical system with colors for each nutrient. This is the logo ""multiple traffic light"" (fire multiple colour) used in Britain, which they defend a modified version.This logo has yet been tested in the various studies and showed performance lower in relation to the official logo NutriScore. Indeed, NutriScore provides a single color reflecting the overall nutritional quality food: the food with the overall composition is the most favourable is green. The alternative logo, it gives a color for each category of nutrient. Thus, the food the best for its low proportion of sugar is green in the category ""sugar"". another color is specified in the categories ""salt"" or ""fat"". This logo is interpretation difficult for the consumer. To choose between two products, for example between a yogurt and a smoothie, it must compare ten information ... instead of only two with the NutriScore. The all, in the brief time of the act of purchase.Moreover, the alternative logo requires prioritize information issued. Between a product high in salt and low in fat, and another high fat and low in salt, which choose? Recognizing should take into account, ideally, all other products already in the cart ... This system has therefore tend to confuse the message made, compared to a more synthetic system.To better understand the objectives pursued by the industrial defending a logo alternative, to a moment in the world that they call their wishes. In its ""manifest NutriCouleurs"" dated October, the union Alliance 7 proposes, as the Big 6, to adopt the British logo in a new version. Instead of displaying the score for 100 grams of food, as in the original version, it plans to calculate on the basis of a ""portion,"" i.e., the amount consumed usually by a person, highly variable concept ... As this is manufacturers that define the size of the portion, the measuring instrument changes according to goodwill, which allows manipulation to receive a color more favourable than in the original version. The thresholds for the preparation of color have also not been made public, and appear to be still subject to negotiations.The case of Twix candy bars, relev̩par UFC What choose, is particularly demonstrative. "" The labels bar Bounty and Twix (produced by Mars Incorporated) indicate portions corresponding to only one of the two sticks of candy contained in the individual bag, the journalist wrote the review. What drastically lower the rate of sugar and fat portion "".In NutriScore, the official logo, the Twix bar is classified in red (E), the least good nutritional quality.By applying NutriCouleurs British, all indicators is red, except for salt, for which the Twix bar is orange.Consider now the same system, NutriCouleurs, but in its amended version proposed by the Big 6 and Alliance 7 (Mars is clearer). Reported to the portion, and taking as assumption that the threshold for the red would be determined by a content for more than 20% of reference intakes, all indicators would be ... orange. Even with a lower threshold (to 15% for example), most indicators would still orange. And that, while the product has not changed composition!The European Commission has given its approval to the signing of the Order confirming the choice of NutriScore in France, for the support requirements of public health. Given the consistency of positions across France and Europe, any reason to ask why the industrial members of Alliance 7 continue to reject the official logo. That several major distributors-Intermarch̩, Auchan and Leclerc-committed to use on their products. Other multinational agri-food-Fleury Michon, Danone and McCain --non.To try to answer this question, we looked at the classification of products of industrial Big 6 in the system NutriScore. Through the database site participatifOpen Food Facts, enriched by the consumers themselves, it is indeed possible to know the composition of most nutritional food and thus the color of those who do not the logo.It appears from this exploration companies supporting alternative logo are those food portfolio contains products particularly sweet, bold or salted, classified at the bottom of the scale of NutriScore. This is sugary drinks, chocolate, confectionery, biscuits, cereals breakfast, ice or aperitifs biscuits. For example, for the group Mars, 100% of food firm on Open Food Facts are classified in orange or red. for Mondelez, 86% of their products present in the base. 55% for Nestl̩. 54% for Coca-Cola. 52% for Unilever and 46% for PepsiCo.The position of industrial refuse the official logo is therefore dictated primarily by their commercial interest and vision marketing situation. Using a logo alternative would result in main parasitizing nutritional information simplified. From our point of view, the right) transparencesur a question also essential for their health food.

R̩sum̩.Cet article a ̩t̩ publi̩ initialement sur le sitedphen octobre 2010, dans le cadre d&#8217.undossier sur la grande distribution.Au cours de l۪ann̩e 2008, laClean Clothes Campaigns۪est entretenue avec 440 travailleurs issus de 30 usines r̩parties dans quatre pays  Sri Lanka, Inde, Bangladesh et Thalande. Toutes ces usines produisaient des v̻tements pour un ou plusieurs des cinq distributeurs suivants : Aldi, Carrefour, Lidl, Tesco et Walmart.Tailles de g̩antWalmart = 253.000.000.000  de ventes en 2007, soit 8 035  chaque seconde.Carrefour = 25.000.000 de clients par jour.Tesco = 1 sur 7 d̩pens̩es dans les magasins au Royaume-Uni.Aldi = 80% des consommateurs allemands y font leurs courses.Lidl = 24 pays europ̩ens dont 22 de l۪Union europ̩enne des 27.Les travailleurs de l۪habillement employ̩s dans les fili̬res d۪approvisionnement des enseignes de la grande distribution doivent, selon les normes internationales du travail, gagner au moins un salaire minimum vital et travailler au maximum 48 heures par semaine. Or ce rapport montre que ces droits ne sont pas respect̩s. Nulle part, dans les usines ayant fait l۪objet de cette enqu̻te, les travailleurs ne gagnent un salaire leur permettant de couvrir leurs besoins de base. La semaine de travail de base de 48 heures est quant  elle une notion d̩nu̩e de sens puisque les heures suppl̩mentaires sont obligatoires et quotidiennes. M̻me le maximum de 60 heures, heures suppl̩mentaires incluses, est rarement respect̩. Enfin, et c۪est ce qui est le plus scandaleux vu leur difficult̩  joindre les deux bouts, ces femmes et ces hommes ne sont m̻me pas pay̩s pour les heures suppl̩mentaires qu۪ils effectuent. Le paiement d۪un salaire major̩ pour les heures suppl̩mentaires  comme le pr̩voit souvent la loi - semble d̬s lors d۪autant plus hors de propos.L۪̩l̩ment d̩terminant si une marque ou un distributeur assume s̩rieusement sa responsabilit̩ n۪est pas la pr̩sence d۪un syndicat sur un lieu de travail, mais bien la garantie, pour les travailleurs, qu۪ils ne subiront pas de repr̩sailles s۪ils tentent de se syndiquer. Ceci exige des signaux forts de la part de l۪acheteur vis--vis des travailleurs et de la direction de l۪usine, ainsi qu۪une formation efficace des responsables locaux comp̩tents. Ce n۪est pourtant le cas dans aucune des usines concern̩es par cette recherche. Presque syst̩matiquement, les travailleurs affirment que l۪attitude de la direction les emp̻che de former un syndicat.Les recherches de la Clean Clothes Campaign en Inde, au Sri Lanka et en Thalande montrent que les travailleurs qui fabriquent des v̻tements pour des enseignes de la grande distribution n۪ont pas de s̩curit̩ de l۪emploi, ni acc̬s  un emploi permanent. Beaucoup de travailleurs sont employ̩s par des agences, d۪autres n۪ont que des contrats temporaires et sont d̬s lors r̩mun̩r̩s plus faiblement. Ils sont en outre confront̩s  des conditions pr̩caires et  la crainte permanente de perdre leur travail. Et le recours  ce type de contrat n۪est malheureusement pas exceptionnel, l۪utilisation syst̩matique de formes pr̩caires d۪emploi visant  g̩rer des commandes variables et  faire pencher davantage la balance du pouvoir en faveur des employeurs.Les enseignes de la grande distribution favorisent des pratiques d۪approvisionnement permettant un maximum de flexibilit̩ et des prix les plus bas possible. En m̻me temps, elles affirment qu۪elles am̩liorent les syst̬mes dont elles disposent pour faire appliquer leurs codes de conduite. Cependant, les pratiques d۪approvisionnement des enseignes de la grande distribution engendrent une s̩rie de pressions qui ont des cons̩quences particuli̬rement n̩fastes pour les travailleurs.Premi̬rement, les enseignes de la grande distribution s̩lectionnent les fournisseurs avec lesquels elles travaillent : la recherche des prix les plus bas les orientent vers des usines dont les propri̩taires, en situation plus pr̩caire ou moins scrupuleux que d۪autres, sont plus enclins  accepter leurs conditions.Deuxi̬mement, la pression engendr̩e par des exigences contradictoires - bonnes conditions de travail d۪une c̫t̩ et production plus rapide et moins on̩reuse de l۪autre  conduit  contourner les proc̩dures de conformit̩. Ce rapport ̩voque des feuilles de pr̩sence et des fiches de paie falsifi̩es, des travailleurs oblig̩s de mentir aux inspecteurs etc. Quelle que soit l۪importance que les grandes entreprises de distribution accordent aux audits sociaux, les faits cit̩s dans ce rapport d̩montrent que leur personnel sur le terrain fait peu ̩tat du foss̩ qui existe entre les conditions dans les usines et celles rapport̩es dans les audits.Enfin, les pressions en mati̬re de d̩lais et de cots, visant  permettre, selon ces enseignes, d۪afficher les prix les plus bas dans les rayons des supermarch̩s, sont directement r̩percut̩es sur les travailleurs sous la forme de l۪ins̩curit̩ d۪emploi et de salaires de mis̬re.Les impacts n̩gatifs des pratiques de la grande distribution ne touchent pas de mani̬re uniforme tous les travailleurs. Ils affectent tout particuli̬rement les femmes, lesquelles sont plus susceptibles d۪occuper des emplois pour lesquels les violations des droits sont courantes. Les femmes sont ̩galement plus susceptibles de faire l۪objet de violations de leurs droits au travail. En outre, les responsabilit̩s productives, reproductives et familiales limitent la capacit̩ des femmes  chercher un autre travail,  entreprendre des d̩marches pour am̩liorer leurs conditions ou  r̩v̩ler les abus dont elles sont victimes. Des contraintes culturelles et ̩conomiques emp̻chent ̩galement les ouvri̬res de parler de leur condition ou de s۪affilier  un syndicat.Les enseignes de la grande distribution affirment qu۪elles prennent des mesures pour r̩soudre les violations des droits du travail commises dans leurs fili̬res d۪approvisionnement. Il apparąt toutefois clairement, d۪apr̬s les r̩sultats de cette enqu̻te, que ces mesures sont toujours insuffisantes. Les pratiques d۪approvisionnement des enseignes de la grande distribution aggravent en outre la situation.Pour la Clean Clothes Campaign, les enseignes de la grande distribution et leurs fournisseurs devraient, outre l۪adoption d۪un code de conduite complet et de mesures efficaces permettant de contr̫ler le respect de ce code par leurs fournisseurs, ̩valuer l۪impact de leurs pratiques d۪approvisionnement et prendre des mesures pour corriger les impacts n̩gatifs de ces pratiques sur l۪ensemble de la fili̬re d۪approvisionnement. Ces enseignes devraient notamment fixer des prix de d̩tail de mani̬re plus responsable, et s۪abstenir de faire de la publicit̩ qui nourrit les attentes du consommateur  l۪̩gard de prix bas non soutenables.En savoir plusLire ou t̩l̩charger le rapport en fran̤aissur le site du collectif thique sur l&#8217.̩tiquette, branche fran̤aise de la Clean Clothes Campaign.;From the great European distribution Asian textile industry An investigation report published by the Clean Clothes Campaign in February 2009, entitled &#171. Cash! &#187., highlights the great signs distribution as Walmart, Tesco, Carrefour, Lidl and Aldi, which play a major role in the industry clothing and benefit from their global impact and their huge market share in many countries to dominate suppliers and force them to offer reduced prices. Summary.This article was published originally on the sitedphen October 2010, under d&#8217. undossier on the great distribution.During the year 2008, laClean Clothes Campaigns'est met with 440 workers from 30 plants distributed in four countries-Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Thailand. All these plants produced clothing for one or more of the five following distributors: Aldi, Carrefour, Lidl, Tesco and Walmart.Sizes g̩antWalmart = 253,000,000,000 billion sales in 2007, 8 035  each second. Carrefour = 25,000,000 customers a day. Tesco = 1 on 7 spent in stores in the United Uni.Aldi = 80% of German consumers are shopping. Lidl = 24 European countries with 22 of the European Union of 27.Workers clothing employees in the supply chains of large signs distribution must, according to the international labour standards, earn at least one vital minimum wage and work up to 48 hours per week. But this report shows that these rights are not respected. Nowhere, in factories that have been in this investigation, workers earn a salary to cover their basic needs. The working week is 48 hours is for a meaningless concept since overtime is mandatory and daily. Even the maximum of 60 hours, overtime included, is rarely respected. Finally, and this is what is the most scandalous saw their difficulty in making ends meet, these women and men are not even paid for overtime they perform. The payment of a salary plus overtime-as often the law-therefore seems even more irrelevant.The element determining whether a mark or a distributor takes seriously its responsibility is not the presence of a union on a workplace, but the guarantee, for workers, they will not reprisals if they try to organize. This requires strong signals from the buyer towards workers and the direction of the plant, as well as effective training of relevant local officials. This is yet the case in any of the plants involved in this research. Almost always, workers say the attitude of the management prevents form a union.Research the Clean Clothes Campaign in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand show that workers who make clothes for signs of the great distribution have not job security, or access to permanent employment. Many workers are employed by agencies, others have temporary contracts and are therefore paid more weakly. They are also faced with precarious conditions and the fear of losing their permanent work. And the use of this type of contract is unfortunately not exceptional, the systematic use of precarious forms of employment to manage orders variables and tip the balance of power more in favour of employers.The signs of the great distribution promote procurement practices for maximum flexibility and price lowest possible. At the same time, they say they improve systems they have to enforce their codes of conduct. However, the procurement practices of the great signs distribution create a series of pressures have particularly adverse consequences for workers.First, the signs of the great distribution select suppliers with which they work: the search for lowest price guide to plants whose owners, more precarious situation or less scrupulous than others, are more likely to accept their conditions.Secondly, the pressure caused by conflicting demands-good working conditions of a side and production faster and less expensive the other-led to circumvent compliance procedures. This report refers to attendance sheets and payroll records falsified, workers forced to lie to inspectors etc. Regardless of the importance that the major distribution companies provide social audits, the facts cited in this report show that their staff on the ground made little status gap between the conditions in factories and those reported in the audits.Finally, pressures of time and cost, to allow, according to the signs, view prices lowest in supermarket shelves, are directly passed on to workers in the form of job insecurity and wage misery.The negative impacts of large distribution practices are not uniformly all workers. They affect especially women, which are more likely to be jobs for which rights violations are common. Women are also more likely to be violations of their rights at work. In addition, responsibilities productive, reproductive and family limit the ability of women to seek another job, to take steps to improve their conditions or to reveal the abuse they are victims. Cultural and economic constraints also prevent workers talk about their condition or join a union.The signs of the great distribution say they take steps to resolve violations of labour rights committed in their supply chains. It appears, however, clearly, according to the results of the investigation, that these measures are still insufficient. The procurement practices of the great signs distribution further aggravate the situation.For the Clean Clothes Campaign, signs of the great distribution and their suppliers should, in addition to the adoption of a code of conduct comprehensive and effective measures to monitor compliance with this code by their suppliers, assess the impact of their procurement practices and take measures to correct the negative impacts of these practices throughout the supply chain. These signs should include set retail price of more responsible, and refrain from advertising that feeds consumer expectations for low prices not sustainable.Learn plusLire or download the report fran̤aissur the collective Ethics site on l&#8217. label, French branch of the Clean Clothes Campaign.

When they are finally arrived, we heard that these services would simply not offered or, in the best of cases, to drops. ""Ms. Perrin, we are aware that your son has great needs, but we have unfortunately not necessary resources to meet the needs of Thomas therapy, speech therapy, physiotherapy and psycho̩ducation."" Vlandans teeth, my great dreamer!Since fourteen years, the major illusions that I promised Quebec, inescapable model of social justice, based as snow in the sun. The austerity of recent years made that the public network to dismantle every day, waiting lists are, not to mention the education network that cracks everywhere and place our children different in large parking lots where they observe the needles turn dial or, at best, where they count the ticking of the clock if they have had the privilege of learning their figures. But where is the valuable social integration that they promised me and I dreamed?A minority without voice Since fourteen years, stories like those experienced by persons with disabilities hired to discount (6 per day) then fired overnight multiply. The case Walmartmet a little light on this reality that affects a minority without voice and their parents too exhausted to decry.Did you know that these so-called employees of Walmart employees were not in the sense of the Labour Code? Did you know that the fragility and precariousness of their workplace near slavery resulting from agreements between the Department of Health and Social Services and these ""corporate citizens copies"". In the end, according to you, which is really responsible for these situations worthy of the Middle Ages?Gentlemen Couillard, Barrette, Proulx and Blais, your ship sinks to peak. The dropping of Walmart is only a dark pasted what was in the newspaper people who face every day to miss blatant and disturbing services. Is there still a captain on board at Quebec to ensure that these people are solid conditions social participation in the long term-and not episodes of services?Dear Quebecker, you have been many to join the wave of indignation and many of you have claimed the top boycott of this string. Thank you for this empathy. People with intellectual disabilities, their families and their relatives ask you a gesture of more. in October, vote for those who will bring real change and contribute to true quality of life for them. As society, we are able to do better than dream.I understand the tragedy and injustice of your personal situation. I come to mind a my own exp experiments with water and lack of institutional resources. A situation much less serious than your but from the m &ecirc. me dynamic. Unfortunately for us (ordinary citizens) how the current election and the structure of government decision-making d cannot give that accidentally good r &eacute. results for the common good and long term. People are tann &eacute. s with reason, the Lib. Currently the CAQ is alliers Corporate int res, since this party, m s background="" are in the polls. Do you think they will be better? This will be the same &ecirc. m me or worse. We must collectively require the proportional vote with compensation. It was r sultera d, more inclusive fighting in parliament, a power-sharing (compromise) and possibly, the structural changes that we d &eacute. sesp &eacute. r ment for need. The &eacute. lections in the system. I am current change nothing. That is wanted.-That. Everything is said in ""a minority, without voice"". People with disabilities are most es &eacute. s time to employ discounts and this, when they can d &rsquo. &eacute. chara employment. The sociId t, and, as for governments, have always fine words but nothing in the facts and in the concrete to help these people. Could also add that when these people work, the psychological bullying from several employees at s will also good train. My nephew, who suffers &rsquo. d a g l &eacute., red, intellectual impairment, suffered the consequences of cons to several places. Should not forget the school environments are often v &eacute., enfers &laquo. bullying &raquo. to these people. Children are certainly not better than the big people.

Pour lui, les pr̩occupations ̩cologistes et d&#8217.emploi sont li̩es.Philippe Poutou, ouvrier  l۪usine Ford de Blanquefort (Gironde) et responsable syndical  laCGTFord, est candidat  l۪̩lection pr̩sidentielle pour le Nouveau parti anticapitaliste (NPA).Reporterre &mdash. En mati̬re d۪environnement, quelles mesures de votre programme vous tiennent particuli̬rement  cur?Philippe Poutou &mdash.Une politique ̩nerg̩tique sociale et environnementale sera forc̩ment men̩e par un service public de l۪̩nergie. Il faut enlever leurs moyens de nuire aux capitalistes et sortir des logiques du priv̩, de la rentabilit̩. On doit exproprier toutes les grosses entreprises du secteur des ̩nergies fossiles comme Total, les mettre sous le contr̫le des salari̩s et de la population et sortir des fossiles. Dans le m̻me temps, il faut sortir du nucl̩aire. Nous nous appuyons sur un sch̩ma de sortie en dix ans, ̩labor̩ par le milieu militant et associatif antinucl̩aire. La centrale nucl̩aire de Fessenheim et tous les r̩acteurs de plus de trente ans doivent ̻tre ferm̩s imm̩diatement.En parall̬le, nous voulons d̩velopper les ̩nergies renouvelables. Ce point reste  discuter en raison des pol̩miques sur les avantages et les inconv̩nients des ̩nergies ̩olienne, mar̩motrice, solaire, etc. Mais l۪avantage, c۪est que ces ̩nergies permettront de relocaliser la production ̩lectrique.  c̫t̩ de ̤a, il faut lutter contre le gaspillage en ̩liminant la publicit̩, les d̩penses ̩lectriques inutiles_ Y compris le tout-voiture et le tout-camion, qui polluent. Ce qui nous am̬ne  la gratuit̩ des transports publics. Nous essayons de r̩pondre globalement  tous les probl̬mes. sinon, ̤a ne parąt pas s̩rieux.L۪agriculture est aussi un choix de soci̩t̩. Les politiques productivistes de concentration du capitalisme poussent les agriculteurs  ̻tre toujours plus rentables et  utiliser de plus en plus de pesticides, fongicides, engrais, etc. Nous, nous combattons les intrants chimiques et discutons d۪un retour aux petites exploitations,  une agriculture de proximit̩, y compris autour des grosses agglom̩rations.  Bordeaux, il y avait pas mal de cultures marąch̬res au nord de la ville. Aujourd۪hui, il n۪y a quasiment plus rien, avec des cons̩quences sociales, alimentaires et environnementales. Comment aider les petits paysans  vivre de leur travail et combattre les banques, les distributeurs et l۪industrie agroalimentaire?  cela s۪ajoute la question du bien-̻tre animal.L۪̩cologie est souvent per̤ue comme une pr̩occupation de bobos. Est-ce compliqu̩ de porter un discours antiproductiviste et ̩colo aupr̬s d۪ouvriers et d۪employ̩s?LeNPAa toujours port̩ ces mesures. Lacommission Ecologie existedepuis le d̩but du parti et notre journal a une rubrique ̩cologie quasiment toutes les semaines. Il y a cinq ans, notre programme disait la m̻me chose. Mais aujourd۪hui, la question ̩cologique prend de l۪ampleur dans l۪opinion publique. du coup, quand nous en parlons, nous sommes davantage entendus. Et encore, je ne peux jamais en parler dans les m̩dias: les interviews portent sur les licenciements, l۪emploi_ jamais sur l۪̩cologie.La prise de conscience progresse y compris dans les milieux prolos. On peut difficilement ignorer que la pollution est devenue catastrophique, provoquant maladies et surmortalit̩. L۪actualit̩ des derniers mois a ̩t̩ marqu̩e par des pics de pollution  Paris, Grenoble, Bordeaux et m̻me dans des endroits recul̩s. Les paysans souffrent de maladies professionnelles. Pr̬s de Bordeaux, des viticulteurs sont morts  cause des pesticides, d۪autres sont en proc̬s contre les fabricants. Le milieu paysan, qui a longtemps ignor̩ ces probl̬mes, commence  r̩sister. M̻me au boulot, on discute un peu de ces questions d۪environnement et de sant̩.Mais quand on bosse dans des secteurs industriels, la question du maintien de l۪emploi est l. Concernant la fermeture de Fessenheim, laCGT̩nergie n۪a pas boug̩ d۪un iota. Pour elle, d̩fense du nucl̩aire et d̩fense des emplois vont de pair. C۪est compl̬tement dingue, parce qu۪on peut discuter de sortie du nucl̩aire tout en parlant reconversion. Un d̩mant̬lement de centrale nucl̩aire dure des d̩cennies. Ce n۪est pas comme si l۪on ̩teignait la lumi̬re et qu۪on se barrait!La catastrophe de Fukushima avait entrąn̩ une prise de conscience du risque nucl̩aire. Mais les ann̩es passent et la peur du nucl̩aire diminue  nouveau, malgr̩ tous les probl̬mes &mdash. les pi̬ces d̩fectueuses dans les r̩acteurs, l۪ASNqui alerte et tout le monde qui continue comme s۪il n۪y avait pas de probl̬me. Difficile de faire face  cette propagande id̩ologique.Dans le secteur automobile, ce n۪est pas facile non plus. LaCGTm̩tallurgie d̩fend la voiture et l۪industrie. Beaucoup consid̬rent toujours que d̩noncer le tout-voiture revient  se priver de son boulot. Mais nous,  laCGTFord, nous nous sommes aper̤us que quand nous ̩voquions les scandales li̩s au diesel dans nos tracts, nos coll̬gues ̩taient plut̫t sensibilis̩s et ouverts  la discussion. Car en r̩alit̩, on s۪en fout de fabriquer des bagnoles. le probl̬me, c۪est d۪avoir un boulot. Un m̩canicien automobile pourrait tr̬s bien travailler non pas sur des voitures ̩lectriques &mdash. qui d̩pendent de l۪̩nergie nucl̩aire et sont une fausse solution&mdash., mais sur des bus. Ou, mieux, sur des trains.Le probl̬me, c۪est qu۪on ne peut pas faire confiance  l۪tat ou aux patrons pour les reconversions. Si demain, on d̩cide de fermer une usine d۪armement, cela entrąnera forc̩ment des licenciements. D۪o_ la question de rendre l۪̩conomie plus collective, de ne pas la laisser entre les mains des capitalistes. Nous voulons que les salari̩s et la population puissent assurer eux-m̻mes les reconversions s۪ils d̩cident d۪abandonner un secteur pour des raisons environnementales et de coh̩rence ̩conomique.Comment se passeraient les reconversions dans une ̩conomie o_ les salari̩s contr̫leraient les outils de production?On peut imaginer des structures nationales et locales o_ la population pourrait discuter de ses besoins et faire des choix politiques. Par exemple, pour le projet d۪a̩roport de Notre-Dame-des-Landes, il faudrait qu۪une population vraiment politis̩e impose ses choix &mdash. plut̫t que des collectivit̩s territoriales qui votent ce qu۪elles ont envie de faire en lien avec les int̩r̻ts des multinationales. Ce n۪est pas ̩vident  imaginer dans un monde hyper individualiste o_ chacun rentre chez soi le soir regarder la t̩l̩ et ne s۪occupe pas de politique. Car il y a d̩j ce probl̬me-l  r̩gler: comment donner envie aux gens de discuter de ce qui les concerne collectivement, pour que les militants et les zadistes ne soient plus les seuls  s۪en occuper?Sur le plan ̩conomique, les salari̩s devraient pouvoir prendre en main l۪organisation du travail et m̻me les choix strat̩giques. L۪exemplede Fralibest tr̬s int̩ressant. Alors qu۪Unilever voulait fermer l۪usine, des salari̩s l۪ont reprise en Scop. Elle est militante d۪un point de vue social: il n۪y a quasiment pas d۪̩carts de salaires, tout est d̩cid̩ collectivement &mdash. la r̩partition des postes, les heures suppl̩mentaires, etc. Elle a ̩galement une dimension ̩colo, puisqu۪elle utilise du th̩ bio, cherche  s۪approvisionner localement_ C۪est bonnard! C۪est  toute petite ̩chelle certes &mdash. ils sont une quarantaine&mdash., mais c۪est hyper bien. Autre exemple, l۪usine Pilpa  Carcassonne, reprise en Scop par des salari̩s qui y produisent les glaces La Belle Aude: ils privil̩gient le bio, les produits locaux_ videmment, les produits sont vendus un peu plus cher, mais cela montre qu۪il est possible de produire en respectant les salari̩s, l۪environnement et la sant̩ de la population.Mais on reproche souvent aux produits bio et de qualit̩ d۪̻tre inaccessibles aux m̩nages modestes_Effectivement, les produits bio sont plus coteux, y compris ceux qu۪on ach̬te en supermarch̩. Mais c۪est aussi une question de politisation. Par exemple, on s۪aper̤oit que les gens issus des milieux les plus pauvres vont souvent fumer, boire et mal manger, alors que tout le monde sait que c۪est mauvais. C۪est li̩  un r̩flexe de r̩sistance  plein de choses. Si le bio est un sujet de discussion dans les milieux militants et syndicalistes, au-del c۪est plus compliqu̩. Il faut avoir envie de s۪y int̩resser, de s۪en occuper, de faire le lien entre la destruction de nos emplois, de l۪environnement et de notre sant̩. Heureusement, les associations ̩colos font un gros boulot de sensibilisation.  Bordeaux, les Amap ont une activit̩ tr̬s militante.Vous insistez sur cette id̩e que les citoyens doivent reprendre la politique en main.  quoi ressemblerait le projet de soci̩t̩ que vous portez, sans pr̩sident de la R̩publique, sans S̩nat, etc.?Il est plus facile de commencer par critiquer ce qui existe! Concernant la fonction pr̩sidentielle, nous trouvons aberrant qu۪un seul individu puisse avoir autant de pouvoir entre les mains. Idem pour les pr̩sidents de r̩gion, les maires_ Il y a un surpouvoir dans toutes les instances d̩mocratiques.L۪autre probl̬me est celui de la repr̩sentation. L۪absence de proportionnelle int̩grale est tr̬s probl̩matique. La concentration du pouvoir dans les gros partis et la professionnalisation des ̩lus aussi. Sans parler de leur r̩mun̩ration excessive:  partir du moment o_ ils touchent de hauts revenus, d̩put̩s et s̩nateurs s۪accrochent  leurs postes et sont compl̬tement li̩s  un milieu social. Cela entrąne une v̩ritable d̩connexion des simples travailleurs. C۪est pourquoi nous voulons plafonner le revenu des ̩lus  2.300euros nets mensuels environ. Nous pr̩conisons aussi le non-cumul des mandats.Mais ces r̬gles ne sont que des mesures d۪urgence. Le v̩ritable objectif, c۪est construire une d̩mocratie qui deviendrait le probl̬me de millions de gens. L۪histoire des luttes sociales nous donne des mod̬les de batailles et de moments d̩mocratiques. La Commune de Paris, il y a pr̬s de 150ans, ̩bauche d۪organisation collective  l۪̩chelle d۪une ville. les exp̩riences de d̩mocratie participative  Porto Alegre, au Br̩sil, avec un mandat tournant et des r̩unions de quartier_ Mais il reste un imp̩ratif incontournable: il faut que la population s۪en m̻le. Un d̩l̩gu̩ qui parle  la place des autres, ce n۪est pas bon! Les gens doivent parler eux-m̻mes pour eux-m̻mes. Sinon, ces outils ne resteront que des coquilles vides.Sur ce plan-l, les Zads sont des exp̩riences int̩ressantes. Pr̬s de Bordeaux, une petite for̻t a ̩t̩ ras̩e  cause d۪un projet de golf, malgr̩ la r̩sistance de jeunes gens. Mais il y a eu des assembl̩es g̩n̩rales, des r̩unions  proximit̩ de cet endroit, avec des militants et des agriculteurs ̩colos qui travaillaient dans le coin. On a discut̩ culture marąch̬re, cot des terres agricoles, pollution des sols, lien entre ruraux et urbains_ On n۪̩tait pas nombreux, une cinquantaine, mais c۪̩tait bonnard! Ce sont de petites ̩bauches. Comment leNPApeut-il aider  les d̩velopper et  les renforcer, c۪est la question!D۪un c̫t̩, vous vous pr̩sentez  l۪̩lection pr̩sidentielle sans avoir l۪intention de remporter le scrutin, pour encourager les gens  s۪int̩resser  la politique. de l۪autre, vous le faites dans le cadre d۪un parti traditionnel_ Quel regard portez-vous sur les formes ̩mergentes de mobilisation sociale &mdash. Nuit debout et t̻tes de cort̬ge?LeNPAa la particularit̩ d۪̻tre  la fois une organisation traditionnelle, ouvri̬re et li̩e au syndicalisme, et tr̬s impliqu̩e dans des collectifs comme les Zads et les Nuits debout. Ce qui est int̩ressant dans ces occupations de sites ou de places, c۪est la mani̬re dont les gens organisent une sorte d۪autogestion. Et le fait qu۪elles ne sont pas limit̩es  une lutte, mais qu۪on y discute de tout: de solidarit̩ avec les migrants de Calais, de questions d̩mocratiques, antiracistes, f̩ministes_ Elles rassemblent aussi des gens assez divers, en ̢ge et en milieux sociaux.Dans l۪activit̩ militante au quotidien, on est tr̬s peu  militer, donc tr̬s peu  faire le boulot. Ce sont les m̻mes qui parlent, qui prennent les initiatives, font les tracts, etc. Pour nous, Nuit debout a ̩t̩ ̩norme. Le rapport ̩tait invers̩: tout le monde militait, prenait la parole_ C۪est hyper reposant, car on n۪est plus celui dont l۪absence pose probl̬me &mdash. si l۪on n۪est pas l, il y en a plein d۪autres! Les Zads, c۪est un peu pareil. Tout n۪est pas rose, on y trouve parfois des r̩flexes sectaires, anti-politiques, anti-organisations, du coup les rapports ne sont pas toujours simples_ Mais tout cela va dans le bon sens.Vous avez aim̩ cet article ?Soutenez Reporterre.Lire aussi :Climat, nucl̩aire, transports: ce que proposent les candidatsSource:milie Massemin pourReporterrePhotos: ric Coquelin/ReporterreInfo19 juin 2017Les r̩sultats des candidats les plus proches de l&#8217.̩cologieReportage19 juin 2017L&#8217.exemplaire victoire de Fran̤ois RuffinBr̬ves13 juin 2017Des d̩put̩s nucl̩aristes n&#8217.ont pas ̩t̩ r̩̩lusEntretien13 juin 2017Absente  l&#8217.Assembl̩e nationale, l۪opposition va s&#8217.exprimer dans la rue";"Philippe Poutou: ""The conscience green progress in the proletarian community"" Your address emailDestinataireTexte your message <a href=""spip.php?Page=spipdf &amp. spipdf=article_pdf &amp. id_article=12050 &amp. nom_fichier=article12050""> <img src=/images/pdf.png></a><a onclick=""favoris ('Philippe Poutou: ""<small class = \' fine \ '> </small>The conscience green progress in the community proles <small class = \' fine \ '> </small>""', 'https: //reporterre.net/Philippe-Poutou-La-aware-Eco-progress-in-the-media-proletaires').

In the environment, what measures your program you are particularly heart?Philippe Poutou &mdash. energy policy social and environmental will necessarily conducted by a public service energy. It must remove their means of harming capitalists and out of logical private, profitability. We must expropriate all big business sector fossil fuels such as Total, put under the control of the employees and the population and out of fossils. In the same time, we must leave the nuclear. We rely on an output schema in ten years, developed by the activist community and anti-nuclear associations. The nuclear plant Fessenheim and all reactors more than thirty years must be closed immediately.In parallel, we want to develop renewable energy. This item remains to discuss due to the controversy over the advantages and disadvantages of energy wind, tidal, solar, etc. But the advantage, it is that these energies will relocate the electric production. In addition to that, we must fight against waste by eliminating advertising, spending unnecessary electrical ... Including all-car and the whole-truck, which pollute. This brings us to the free public transport. We are trying to respond globally to all problems. otherwise, it is not serious.Agriculture is also a choice of society. Productivist policies of concentration of capitalism are farmers to always be more cost-effective and use more pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers, etc. We, we are fighting the chemical inputs and are discussing a return to small farms, agriculture proximity, including around the big towns. At Bordeaux, there were a lot of vegetable crops north of the city. Today, there is almost nothing, with social consequences, food and environmental. How to help small farmers to live their work and combat banks, distributors and the agri-food industry? Is the question of animal welfare.The ecology is often perceived as a concern of sores. Is difficult to wear a speech antiproductiviste and green with workers and employees?LeNPAa always brought these measures. Ecology of the existedepuis the beginning of the party and our newspaper has a topic ecology almost every week. Five years, our program said the same thing. But today, the question is growing ecological in the public opinion. suddenly, when we are talking, we are more heard. And yet, I cannot ever speak in the media: interviews with layoffs, employment ... never on ecology.The awareness progresses including pleb circles. It is difficult to ignore that pollution is become catastrophic, causing diseases and mortality. The news of recent months has been marked by pollution peaks in Paris, Grenoble, Bordeaux and even in remote locations. The peasants suffer from occupational diseases. Almost Bordeaux, wine died because of pesticides, others are in trial against manufacturers. The middle peasant, which has long ignored these problems, begins to resist. Even at work, we discussed a few environmental issues and health.But when you bump in industrial sectors, the question of maintaining employment is here. With the closure of Fessenheim, laCGT̩nergie has not moved an inch. For her, defence nuclear and defence jobs go hand in hand. It is completely crazy, because we can discuss output nuclear while speaking conversion. A dismantling of nuclear plant lasts decades. It is not as if we extinguished the light and we are closed!The Fukushima disaster had led to awareness of the nuclear risk. But the years pass and the fear of nuclear decreases again, despite all the problems &mdash. the defective parts in the reactors, the ASNqui alert and everyone continues as if there was no problem. Difficult to deal with this ideological propaganda.In the automotive sector, this is not easy either. LaCGTm̩tallurgie defends the car and industry. Many still consider that denounce the whole-car returns to be deprived of his job. But we laCGTFord, we found that when we refer to the scandals related to diesel in our leaflets, our colleagues were rather aware and open to discussion. Because in reality, doing the manufacture of cars. the problem, that is to have a job. A car mechanic could very well work not on electric cars &mdash. that depend on nuclear energy and are a false solution &mdash., but on buses. Or, better, on trains.The problem is that we cannot trust the State or the patterns for reconversions. If tomorrow, we decided to close a plant weapons, it will necessarily layoffs. Hence the question of making the economy more collective, not leave between the hands of capitalists. We want employees and the population can ensure themselves reconversions if they decide to abandon a sector for environmental reasons and economic consistency.How would reconversions in an economy where employees control tools production?One can imagine national and local structures where the population could discuss its needs and make political choices. For example, for the airport project of Notre-Dame-des-Landes, it should be a really politicized population imposes its choices &mdash. rather than territorial communities vote what they have to link with the interests of multinationals. This is not clear to imagine in a world where each home hyper individualistic itself the evening watching TV and is not policy. Because there is already that problem to solve: how to want people to discuss what is collectively, to activists and zadistes are not the only deal with?Economically, employees should be able to take charge of the organization of work and even strategic choices. The example Fralibest very interesting. While Unilever wanted to close the plant, employees have failover Scop. It is a social activist point of view: there is virtually no differences in wages, everything is decided collectively &mdash. the distribution of posts, overtime, etc. It also a green dimension, since it uses tea bio, seeks to supply locally ... bonnard! It is a small scale certainly &mdash. they are a &mdash. quarantine, but it is hyper. Another example, the plant Pilpa to Carcassonne, failover Scop by employees who produce ice The Belle Aude: they focus on bio, local products ... Of course, products are sold a little more, but it shows that it is possible to produce according to the employees, the environment and health of the population.But we often blame organic products and quality to be inaccessible to modest households ... Indeed, organic products are more expensive, including those we buy in supermarket. But it is also a question of politicization. For example, we find that people from the community poor often go smoke, drink and eat poorly, while everyone knows that this is wrong. It is linked to a reflex resistance full of things. If the bio is a matter of discussion in the community activists and trade unionists, beyond is more complicated. We must want to be, deal with, the link between the destruction of our jobs, the environment and our health. Fortunately, associations eco-fundamentalists are a big job awareness. At Bordeaux, AMAPs have a very militant activity.You insist on the idea that citizens must resume policy hand. What would the draft society that you wear, without the president, without Senate, etc.?It is easier to begin by criticizing what exists! With the presidential function, we find absurd that one individual can have as much power in the hands. Same for the presidents of region, mayors ... There is a surpouvoir in all instances democratic.The other problem is that of the representation. The lack of full proportional is very problematic. The concentration of power in the big parties and the professionalization of the elected. Not to mention their excessive pay: from the time they affect high income, members and senators cling to their positions and are completely linked to a social environment. This results in a real disconnect simple workers. That is why we want to cap the income elected to 2,300 euros monthly net approximately. We also advocate non-accumulation of mandates.But these rules are emergency measures. The real goal is build a democracy that would become the problem of millions of people. The history of social struggles gives us models battles and democratic times. The Commune of Paris, nearly 150 years, draft collective organization across a city. the experiences of participatory democracy in Porto Alegre, Brazil, with a mandate turning and meetings of neighborhood ... But it remains a key imperative: to the population is involved. A delegate who spoke instead of others, this is not good! People must talk themselves to themselves. Otherwise, these tools will only empty shells.On this plan, the Zads are interesting experiences. Almost Bordeaux, a small forest was razed because of a draft golf, despite the resistance of young people. But there was general meetings, meetings near this place, with activists and farmers eco-fundamentalists who worked in the corner. It was discussed gardening culture, cost of agricultural land, soil contamination, link between rural and urban ... It was not many, a fifties, but it was bonnard! These are small drafts. How leNPApeut help develop and strengthen, it is the question!On the one hand, you present to the presidential election without the intention to win the election, to encourage people to be interested in politics. on the other, you made in the framework of a traditional party ... What next to you on emerging forms of social mobilization &mdash. Night standing and heads procession?LeNPAa the particularity of being both a traditional organization, working-class and linked to the trade unionism, and very involved in collective as Zads and Nuits standing. What is interesting in these occupations sites or places, it is how people organize a kind of self. And the fact that they are not limited to a struggle, but we discussed: solidarity with migrants from Calais, democratic, anti-racist issues, feminists ... They gather people quite different, age and social circles.In the militant activity in daily, is very little to advocate, therefore very little to do the job. The same speak, which take initiatives, are leaflets, etc. For us, Night stand has been enormous. The report was reversed: everyone was, took the floor ... hyper based, because it is no longer that the absence problem &mdash. if it is not there, there are plenty of others. The Zads, is a little like that. It is not pink, it is sometimes sectarian reflexes, anti-political, anti-organizations, so reports are not always simple ... But it is common sense.You have liked this article?Support Reporterre.Lire also :Climat, nuclear, transport: propose candidates Source :milie Massemin pourReporterre Photos:  Eric Coquelin / Reporterre Info19 June 2017Les results of candidates closest to l&#8217. ̩cologieReportage19 June 2017L &#8217 .exemplaire victory of Fran̤ois RuffinBr̬ves13 June 2017Des Members nucl̩aristes n&#8217. have not been r̩̩lusEntretien13 June 2017 ""Absent l&#8217.

In addition, the great group is responsible, just like any other sector, l &rsquo. homogenization of varieties of fruits and vegetables for several decades. Indeed, l &rsquo. agribusiness lobbies as actors in the great distribution participated together to the disappearance of traditional varieties. Are we not precisely in front of the causes of the disappearance of peasants?According to Patrick Kochko, coordinator duR̩seau Paysannes Seeds, the economic model of large surfaces based on s &rsquo.

In appearance, it is commendable to l &rsquo. focus on issues raised by the seed. The problem is real since the system catalog prevents since its establishment in 1981 farmers sell seed that n &rsquo. there would not. In less d &rsquo. a Century, it is estimated that 75% of edible varieties have disparu&#8230. therefore good reason &rsquo. indignant against the national catalogue. D &rsquo. a hand, this tool in no way reflects the work of peasants, who select, crops after harvest, the best varieties and thus preserve biodiversity. Furthermore, it is alleged to serve private interests: according to the Seed Paysannesle national catalogue is ""a tool for radical monopoly exercised by l &rsquo. industry on seed."" And for cause, l &rsquo. registration catalog is pay and d &rsquo. admission criteria would tend to promote seed with productivist ambitions.

5979e6e49ad5885bf96d4316;R1635;social;"How multinationals use climate change to impose an industrial agricultural modelGreen CapitalismGovernments are keeping an eye on the agricultural sector&#8217.s greenhouse gas emissions. A new concept is emerging: ""climate-smart agriculture,"" with the objective of producing more, better. In the arena of climate negotiations, multinational corporations are getting set to promote ""smart fertilizers"" and plants genetically modified for heat tolerance. While industrial agriculture is about to win the battle with organic agriculture, researchers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are trying to overturn the deal.Initially published inFrench. Translated by Leslie Thatcher,Truth OutClose to a quarter of the world&#8217.s greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture[1]. A worrying figure, and a disturbing one since it includes all agricultural systems of production, from ""conventional"" agriculture to organic agriculture, from battery farming to pasturing, from industrial monocultures to small, mixed farms. While farmers are blamed for their responsibility in climate change, actors from industrial agriculture take advantage of these conflations to greenwash their image.That&#8217.s the case of Yara International, a Norwegian company and leader in synthetic fertilizers that in 2014 sold more than 26 tons of fertilizer in 150 countries[2]. The group is throwing itself into ""sustainable intensification."" Its idea? Increased use of chemical fertilizers will increase productivity and thus allow less area to be under cultivation and avoid those emissions linked to the expansion of cultivation to now-forested areas.This argument has not convinced the agricultural NGO Grain, which, in anew report, emphasizes that fertilizer manufacturers figure ""among the primary enemies of the climate at a global level."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reckons that for every 100 kilos of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the ground, one kilo turns up in the atmosphere in the form of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. ""Their products could be responsible for close to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions without even mentioning the damage brought about to waterways, soils and the ozone layer,"" adds the NGO, a discrepancy between its walk and its talk that earns Yara a nomination for the Prix Pinocchio du climat (climate Pinocchio prize) 2015[3].The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) does not share that opinion: It considers sustainable intensification a ""smart"" solution in confronting climate change. In spite of the criticisms formulated by NGOs, Yara is one of the multinationals that have recently joined theGlobal Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture(GACSA), whichassemblescountries, environmental conservation NGOs, universities and research centers[4]. The concept of climate-smart agriculture is based on three pillars. First of all, the FAO explains, it&#8217.s a matter of increasing agricultural productivity to confront the increase in global population, then of ""adapting agricultural systems"" to cope with extreme climate events likely to increase, such as floods and droughts. The third pillar is the implementation of agricultural practices that ""reduce"" greenhouse gas emissions.Basta!has plunged into the guide to ""climate-smart"" initiatives[5]. On the menu of miracle cures: herbicide-tolerant rapeseed that allows the use of ""fewer and ever less toxic chemical products,"" and drought-tolerant corn, which would increase yields by ""20 to 30 percent"" - assertions that the Inf&#8217.OGM organizationdisputes. In September 2015, a hundred organizationssigned an appealthat rebukes GACSA for its failure to specify the criteria that would allow a definition of what may, or may not, qualify as a ""smart response"" to climate change.""There&#8217.s been no work on defining the criteria for climate-smart agriculture because defining would result in excluding existing agricultural practices,"" said Jeanne-Maureen Jorand of CCFD-Terre Solidaire. ""Meanwhile, without norms or criteria of exclusion, this concept is quite simply dangerous.""""Defining climate-smart agriculture was a red line for the French government,"" Jorand said. During the launch of GACSA, Annick Girardin, [French] secretary of state for the development of Francophonie, warned against the risks of certain practices such as GMOs or recourse to fuel crops. ""We must be vigilant not to support everything in the name of the struggle against climate disorder and to assure that the solutions we put in place do not create more problems than they resolve,"" she declared in September 2014. The French government finally decided to join GACSA along with 21 other countries, explaining to AFP that it wanted ""to be inside rather than outside, to have an influence.""That&#8217.s also the position of certain research organizations, such as theCenter for International Cooperation in Agronomic Research for Development(CIRAD)[6]. ""The definition is not sufficiently rigorous, which leaves the door open for different ways of intensifying and for a vision of a more industrial agriculture,"" said Emmanuel Torquebiau, climate change task force director at CIRAD. ""We&#8217.re fighting within GACSA to assert our perspective.""""We&#8217.re proposing scientific studies that would allow us to verify what falls within ecological climate-smart agriculture and what is greenwashing,"" Torquebiau added. ""It&#8217.s a matter of staying within these networks to put some science in there, because there&#8217.s a lot of smoke screens.""CIRAD, which works mainly with countries in the global South, encourages ecological agricultural practices, such as permanent ground cover in order to increase organic matter, trap carbon dioxide and limit recourse to fertilizers. INRA, the National Institute for Agricultural Research, also a GACSA member,encouragesagroforestry, for example, by planting ""cereal grains under trees to better resist dryness.""However, the battle between agroecology and industrial agriculture is strongly tilted within the alliance, which contains a strong private sector representation. In addition to active members such as Danone, the alliance contains the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which includes many multinationals. According to the NGOs, about 60 percent of GACSA members are from the fertilizer private sector[7].. Emblematic of their strategy, Walmart, the world leader in retail distribution, wants to reduce emissions by associating its suppliers with the ""fertilizer optimization"" programs developed by Yara[8].Concretely, the orange plantations of PepsiCo, a Walmart supplier, must now use Yara&#8217.s nitrogen fertilizers labeled ""low-carbon footprint."" Supposed to lead to less runoff, these fertilizers aim to ""avoid a situation where only organically produced food would gain the climate brand of approval,"" explains Yara.Invited last March to the third meeting for climate-smart agriculture in Montpellier, French Minister of Agriculture St̩phane Le Foll emphasized that soils can act as ""carbon sinks.""""The more you increase organic matter in your soils, the more you store greenhouse gas,"" he said. ""Moreover, you increase yields!""The government has launched an international research program entitled ""4 for 1,000."" By increasing the soil&#8217.s carbon-stocking capacity by 0.4 percent per year through the implementation of certain not-yet-defined agricultural practices, this project strives to absorb and store 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and, in addition, to restore depleted croplands, notably in the arid and near-arid zones of the African continent.""Given the figures I&#8217.ve made public,"" Le Foll said, ""the stakes more than justify the risk - and would also warrant that we finance tomorrow&#8217.s techniques, developments and production models through the carbon market."" If it succeeds, the 4 for 1,000 project could also become a tool for compensating for private companies&#8217. greenhouse gas emissions, along the lines of Air France&#8217.s project in the forests of Madagascar. ""Carbon finance and financial investors are entrusted with a central role,"" the association Attac and the Conf̩d̩ration Paysanne [Peasant Confederation] deplore in a common memorandum on climate-smart agriculture. ""Yet these measures have demonstrated their ineffectiveness and inability to generate a post-carbon transition. There&#8217.s no reason why it should be any different in agriculture.""A few days before the opening of COP21, civil society organizations asked governments not to recognize ""climate-smart agriculture"" as a possible solution to climate change, a position shared by the [French] secretary of state for the development of Francophonie who insisted in September 2014 that GACSA ""not come interfere and interject itself into the climate negotiations."" Contacted by Basta!, the [French] Agriculture Ministry emphasized that climate-smart agriculture could appear on the ""solutions agenda,"" a text assembling the commitments of non-state actors, which could appear alongside the agreement negotiated in Paris.""The 4 for 1,000 initiative already appears in that agenda,"" Jeanne-Maureen Jorand said. A roundtable on low-carbon technologies (LCPTI), sponsored by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and supported by the French government, also appears on the agenda. Among those invited to this roundtable figures none other than - Monsanto!""It&#8217.s a catastrophe,"" Jorand said. ""The government is in the process of institutionalizing this agenda of solutions and of validating climate-smart agriculture without any criteria and without any discussion."" Questioned on this topic, the Agriculture Ministry declined to comment.Sophie Chapelle&mdash.Photo:  CC Malcolm Carlaw[1]In an assessment published in April 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) deems that greenhouse gas emissions related to agriculture, forestry and fisheries represent 10 to 12 gigatons equivalent carbon dioxide, or 24 percent of global emissions.[3]""The objective of the Prix Pinocchio du Climat is to illustrate and denounce the negative impacts of multinational companies and especially those that whitewash themselves with &#8217.green&#8217. talk.""[4]This alliance was launched in September 2014, during the New York climate summit, by the World Bank, the CGIAR (a consulting group for international agricultural research) and the FAO.[6]Member of the AllianceCIRAD organizedthe third international conference on climate-smart agriculture in Montpellier, March 16-18, 2015.[7]This over-representation is assured through professional alliances such as the International Association of Fertilization Industries or the ""Fertilizer Institute"" of which Yara is a member[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]";

These gates are intended to be used at the bottom of the stairway or in a doorway between two rooms. They are not solid enough to be used at the top of the stairs and this could lead to accidents, Ikea warns.These gates have been sold in the Netherlands since 1995.

This d̩couvertepubli̩e in the revueSciencecl̫t a debate raging since 30 years about the existence of liquid water on the red planet and strengthens the opportunity to detect the presence of living organisms.The valleys, canyons, rivers and lakes dried observed the surface of Mars are the traces of the past presence of liquid water on the planet, but since scientists are more closely, no mass of liquid water Permanent had yet been found. It is using the radar MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) present aboard the probe spatialeMars Expressde European Space Agency (ESA) that Roberto Orosei, the National Institute of Astrophysics in Bologna, Italy, and his colleagues have discovered the existence of this lake water liquid buried under 1.5 kilometres of ice near the south pole of the planet.MARSIS emits radio waves ""which penetrate the ice and are thoughtful to interfaces between different materials, such as contact between the ice and rock, sediment or water liquid,"" said Anja Diez, the Norwegian Polar Institute, in a commentary published also in the revueScience. However, surveys by radio echoes made using airborne radar over Antarctica have shown that ""the signal reflected by a surface liquid water underground is more brilliant and greater intensity as reflected by surfaces of rock or sediment"".Mr.Orosei and his colleagues have identified among the waves and reflected by the groundwater interfaces that MARSIS has surveyed, then queMars Expresssurvolait the ice south pole of Mars between May 2012 and December 2015, a surface of approximately 20 km width at 1.5 km depth of a brightness very similar to that encountered discovery of subglacial lakes in Antarctica and Greenland.The data collected by the radar also suggest that the temperature of the liquid water would reach -10 to -20 degrees Celsius, a temperature much lower than the freezing point of pure water. ""But we know that the presence of salts of magnesium, calcium, sodium and perchlorate found everywhere on Mars may lower the freezing point of water to -70  C"", saidOrosei.The Martian subglacial lake detected by the Italian researchers would be a real brine! But it would not be a unique geological phenomenon, since two lakes water hypersalt compounds, were recently discovered 600 to 800 metres ice within the ice of Devon in the Canadian Arctic, reported revueScience Advancesen last April.Living organisms could live in a salt water also and also cold? "" We do not yet know well enough the chemical composition of this lake to answer this question. But we know that there are microorganisms that live in similar conditions on Earth, temperatures below 0  C, and use the salt in their metabolism. It can therefore issue the hypothesis that micro-organisms could survive in such an environment. But we have to go draw a sample of water for the confirm, "" Mr.Orosei. "" We know that the initial environment of Mars was very similar to that of the Earth. All the two had a very dense atmosphere and very rich in carbon dioxide and had liquid water to their surface, ""noted Robert Lamontagne, former professor of astronomy at the University of Montreal."" On Earth, life is emerged fairly quickly. One can imagine that the same scenario could take place on Mars, but the conditions are rapidly deteriorated. But if there has been emergence of microbial life previously on Mars, and that there is still liquid water in underground pockets, perhaps some of these microbes were able to adapt to these new conditions, ""he said."" It may be that this water tank that we have discovered has always existed on Mars, says Mr.Orosei. We know that the climate of Mars has suffered drastic changes during its history. There are 3.5 billion years, Mars had a climate much warmer and an atmosphere that allowed the water sink and accumulate its surface. Then, the climate has changed, the planet has lost its atmosphere, which has led to the disappearance of the surface water and the establishment of a desert cold and dry. If we find other lakes of liquid water, in other regions, we can confirm that liquid water was present throughout the history of the planet. "" For the moment, the team of Mr.Orosei does not have sufficient data to say that there are water elsewhere in the basement of Mars.For Mr.Lamontagne, ""this discovery adds an additional element to our knowledge of Mars"". "" The geological traces on the surface of the planet, such as lakes and rivers dried and sedimentary layers, we indicate that the water has been present in the past. Mars Express has revealed as 2003 the presence of water ice at the South Pole. In 2008, the probe Phoenix which has asked the surface of Mars was also detected water ice in the sand covering the Martian soil. The probe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has helped see dark streaks that were on the flanks of craters during the summers that Mars would be a kind of brine. These observations indicating the existence of water on this planet, ""he said."" Moreover, this lake has terrestrial equivalents in the Antarctic. This discovery adds a new similarity between the Earth and Mars! ""Certainly,"" this water tank that is probably not the only will be of great use for humans who will explore Mars! "" He said.Researchers use decoys pulp shape to study the biodiversity of the forest montr̩alaise.NASA has pushed back the boundaries of space exploration, but also experienced tremendous failures. 1 / Pr &eacute. cautionsCette d &eacute. covered is great.

597a065bd848472c164d1bcd;R1883;HS;"CommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantHow do you talk about joy in times like these and not sound like a traveling salesman with a bottle of snake oil up his sleeve?Recently, I received word that Robert Gittelson, the cofounder of Conservatives for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, had died suddenly from a massive     heart attack. Over the next seven days, the prolific 63-year-old comedian and actor, Robin Williams, committed suicide, and revered screen legend, Lauren     Bacall, passed away at the age of 89.Track back a few weeks, reports of three separate senseless deaths of black men at the hands of police officers rocked the nation:1.Eric Garner, 43, was selling untaxed cigarettes on a street in Staten Island when two police officers approached him and attempted to arrest him. Mr. Garner put his     hands up, but Officer Daniel Pantaleo put Garner, an asthmatic, in a chokeholdwhich the NYPD has bannedand wrestled him to the ground. He continued to     apply the chokehold even after Garner warned that he couldn۪t breathe multiple times. Garner died.2.John Crawford, 22, was in an Ohio Walmart speaking on a cell phone with the mother of his children while holding a toy rifle that he۪d picked up from a nearby shelf. A     shopper got concerned and called the police. According to reports, police demanded that he drop the weapon. Crawford allegedly said, It۪s not real.۝ They     shot him. He screamed and cried, according to the woman on the cell phone. Then he died.3.Michael Brown, 18, was a few days from entering his freshman year in college when he was gunned down by a police officer while walking home from a convenience store.     Eyewitnesses and police have offered disputing accounts.Over the same period, the nation was glued to news of missionary doctors entering the United States to receive treatment for the Ebola virus. Then, this     week, the U.S. manufacturer of the experimental Ebola antibody saidthey had run out of the drug.CNN aireddramatic footagefrom one of its reporters embedded on an Iraqi military helicopter mission that dropped boxes of food and water and rescued desperateYazidiIraqis hiding on a mountaintop to flee persecution by the Sunni militant group,ISIS.Oh, did I mention thatHouse Republicans voted to sue President Obamafor     not enforcing part of the Affordable Care Act that they tried to prevent earlier? Meanwhile, the president announced plans forexecutive action on immigration reformdespite the most inactive Congress in modern American history.So _ to think of joy right now, reminds me of snake oil.When we planned to focus this issue ofFaith in Actionon the spiritual discipline of joy we had no idea how challenging that call would be.When I think of joy, I think of women in sundresses running through fields of daisies, blankets and baskets brimming with great food and wine in tow. I     think of babies laughing and little girls playing hopscotch and little boys playing marbles.But perhaps none of that is joy after all. Perhaps what my youth group leader told me years ago is true. Those are images of happiness. They are fleeting.     Joy runs deeper.Joy is like the deepest leagues of the ocean. Though hurricanes rage above, it stands still. Joy is like the sun and the moon: No matter what happens on     earth, they are constant. They rise and rise and rise again.Joy smilesperiod. It is almost sly, smiling in the face of disaster, as if it knows a secret.Or, does joy smile in the face of disasters as a non-violent weapon wielded against the lie that all is lost?Joy۪s smile states simply, with the only energy it can muster in the face of this fallen world: All is not lost. This is not the end of the story. And     though the world rages around me and may threaten my very being, I am whole and complete because God is.Maybe that۪s where Paul۪s charge to the Philippians comes from. This man who endured persecution, shipwreck, poverty, and Roman oppression said,     unequivocally:Rejoice in the Lord always: again I say Rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not worry about anything, but in         everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all         understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.(Philippians 4:4-7)Perhaps joy brings peace because joy lives in the deep_and God is in the deep. So, on this day when news cycles rage and injustices beg to be engaged, in     the middle of hurricanes raging, I feel a smile forming in the deep waters of my soul.Peace is coming.Lisa Sharon Harperis Senior Director of Mobilizing for Sojourners and co-author ofForgive Us: Confessions of a Compromised Faith forthcoming September 2014, Zondervan.View the discussion thread.I will express myself with civility, courtesy, and respect for every member of the Sojourners online community, especially toward those with whom I disagree, even if I feel disrespected by them.

La commissione degli Affari sociali del Senato ha approvato mercoled un emendamento al bilancio della S̩cu, il sistema di sicurezza sociale francese, cheaumenter del 300% la tassa sull'olio di palmautilizzato in tantissimi prodotti alimentari, tra cui la discussa e famosa crema di cacao della Ferrero.""Produrre olio di palma provoca deforestazioni massicce che compromettono l'ecosistema.  tempo che i consumatori se ne rendano conto"",ha dettoil ministro del Budget,Jer̫me Cahuzac, convinto sostenitore dell'""emendamento Nutella"". L'olio di palma, infatti, ̬ accusato non solo di avere effetti nocivi sulla salute umana, ma anche dicrimini ambientali gravissimi, come il taglio a raso della foresta pluviale del Borneo, l'incendio e degrado delle ultime torbiere indonesiane o la cattura ed uccisione degli ultimi oranghi del Borneo e di Sumatra. L'olio di palma, insomma, fa male efavorisce la deforestazione, con conseguente perdita di habitat per tantissime specie vegetali e animali.""La sovrattassa sull'olio di palma ̬un segnale alle industrie agro-alimentariperch̩ sostituiscano questo ingrediente con altre sostanze meno dannose. L'olio di palma ̬ molto usato perch̩ costa poco ma ̬ troppo ricco di acidi grassi saturi nocivi per la salute"", ha spiegato il relatore della commissione,Yves Daudigny. Contenuto nel disegno di legge di finanziamento della sicurezza sociale 2013 (PFLSS), il provvedimento si traduce, nella realt dei fatti, in uncontributo aggiuntivo di 300 euro per tonnellata, che, tra l'altro, consentir alle casse dello Stato di riscuotere 40 milioni di euro in pi_.L'obiettivo dichiarato ̬ quello di vedere diminuto l'utilizzo di questo prodotto, contenutoanche in tanti prodotti vegan o biologici, ""eccessivamente utilizzato dalla ristorazione e dall'industria alimentare e contenuto in tantissimi prodotti, tra cui biscotti e cibi dolci o salati, destinati bambini"", conclude Daudigny. Per Ferrero si tratta, al contrario, di un emendamento infondato ed ingiusto, sia sul piano nutrizionale che ambientale. ""Ferrero, da sempre attentissima alla qualit dei suoi prodotti e delle sue materie prime, utilizza olio di palma perch̩le sue propriet intrinseche conferiscono al suo principale prodotto, Nutella, le caratteristiche uniche di gusto, di consistenza e nutrizionali"", si legge in una nota.""Contrariamente ad alcune comunicazioni opportuniste -prosegue l'Azienda-, sostenute da produttori di altri tipi di olio vegetale, ̬ falso affermare che l'olio di palma sia dannoso per la salute: esso infatti non contiene grassi idrogenati, che invece sono dannosi"". La selezione delle nostre materie prime ""ci permette inoltre di aver unolio di palma perfettamente compatibile con il rispetto dell'ambiente, al quale Ferrero tiene particolarmente"", conclude la ""rassicurante"" nota. Intanto anche i detrattori alzano la voce e, puntando sull'aspetto che riguarda la salute, parlano di mis ura non sufficiente per correggere le scorrette abitudini alimentari dei cugini d'oltralpe, propriocome era successo da noi per le bibite gassate.Forse l'emendamento francese non salver il mondo, ma gli va riconosciuto il merito dipuntare i riflettori su un problema gravissimo, fornendo un primo trampolino di lancio per prendere coscienza di tutti i pericoli che derivano dall'uso e dal consumo dell'olio di palma e fare in modo che le aziende cambino politica. Nel frattempo, il consiglio resta sempre quello di boicottarlo,leggendo bene le etichette e autoproducendo(qui, ad esempio,la ricetta per preparare la buonissima Nutella Vegan).  Possiamo fare perfettamente a meno dell'olio di palma nelle nostre diete,occorre solo un po' di impegno.Roberta RagniLeggi anche:-Olio di palma: perche' e' dannoso per la salute e per l'ambiente-Nutella: arriva dall'UE la minaccia per la crema spalmabile pi_ famosa al mondo";"France tax the Nutella, probably one of the prodottimade in Italypi_ loved and met.

The palm oil, in fact, is accused not only to have harmful effects on human health, but also dicrimini serious environmental, such as cut satin of the rainforest of Borneo, the fire and degradation of the last Indonesian peatlands or the capture and killing of the last orangutans of Borneo and Sumatra.

The surcharge on palm oil industries signal Mr. agro-alimentariperch̩ replace this ingredient with other less harmful substances. The palm oil is very used because cheap but it's too rich in saturated fatty acids are harmful to health, "" said the rapporteur of the committee, Yves Daudigny. Content in the bill of funding social security 2013 (PFLSS), the measure translates, in reality of the facts, in uncontributo additional 300 euros per tonne, which, by the way, will the state coffers to collect 40 million euros more.The stated goal is to see diminuto the use of this product, contenutoanche so many vegan or organic products, ""overly used by the catering and the food industry and content in many products, including cookies and sweet or salty foods, intended for children,"" concludes Daudigny. For Ferrerro it is, on the contrary, an amendment unfounded and unfair, both on the nutritional and environmental plan. ""Ferrero, always careful to the quality of its products and its raw materials, uses palm oil perch̩le its intrinsic properties confer its main product, Nutella, the unique characteristics of taste, texture and nutrition"", said in a statement.""Contrary to some opportunistic communications -prosegue the Company, incurred by producers of other types of vegetable oil, is false to say that the palm oil is harmful to your health : it in fact contains no hydrogenated fats, which are harmful."" The selection of our raw materials ""also allows us to have unolio palm perfectly compatible with respect for the environment, to which Ferrero keeps particularly"", concludes the ""reassuring"" note. Meanwhile, the critics raise the voice and, pointing to the appearance about the health, talking about GrossM ura not enough to correct the improper food habits of cousins of letter, I had happened to us for the fizzy drinks.Maybe the French amendment will not save the world, but he's recognized the credit dipuntare the spotlight on a serious problem, providing a first launch pad to take conscience of all the dangers that arise from the use and the consumption of palm oil and make sure that companies change their policy. Meanwhile, the board remains always the boycott, reading good labels and autoproducendo (here, for example, the recipe to prepare the delicious Nutella Vegan).

C &rsquo. is a new blow to l &rsquo. palm oil from deforestation, and a step forward for our campaign: Carrefour just announced a new policy on purchase d &rsquo. &rsquo. palm oil (see on the site of Carrefour).  The second largest distributor World aims to products of its own brands contain more d &rsquo. palm oil contributing to deforestation. More In December 2013, the largest dealer of palm oil in the world (nearly 40% market share of global palm oil), Wilmar International, is committed to establish a policy ""of zero deforestation"".  (See our ticket &#8211. Wilmars &rsquo. committed to ending deforestation) After Wilmar, Cargill, another big international dealer in palm oil, which discovered the necessary commitments in favour of a policy of non deforestation. For several years, Greenpeace campaign with traders, distributors, to encourage them to review their policy on purchase of palm oil.

A phenomenon that contributes to climate change and l &rsquo. habitat threat last 400 Sumatran tigers left. Uner̩cente study published by the journal Naturemontre again how urgent it is to act.  This is indeed in Indonesia that the pace of deforestation is the highest.  Between 2000 and 2012, the country has lost 16 million d &rsquo. hectares of forest, an area equal to the Greece! ... In order to protect forests, it is, of course, to determine first which is a forest and what n &rsquo.. With The Forest Trust (TFT) and l &rsquo. Indonesian palm oil company Golden Agri Resources (RBM), Greenpeace has developed a method to identify and protect different areas (forests, peatlands, valuable natural areas and arable land of local communities) that n &rsquo. do not account for the development of plantations. A method named BC-HCS (High Carbon Stock).  (read the briefing on the site of Greenpeace International). With the support of Greenpeace and WWF, a number of producers joined in Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG).

Producers of palm oil have therefore no other choice, given the requirements of many companies, to propose a palm oil &laquo. own &raquo.. At the beginning of the month of July, a number of major producers d &rsquo. palm oil, including Sime Darby, Musim Mas, KLK and Asian Agri, presented the ""Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto"".  A document through which signatories &rsquo. s commitment, according to their own words, to no longer contribute to deforestation. But &laquo. not contribute to deforestation "" is a very relative concept for these companies.  Indeed, instead d &rsquo. apply the existing HCS method, supporters of the manifest want d &rsquo. first submit an evaluation.  And refuse, before obtaining his result, put an end to deforestation.  Of course, a refinement of the HCS will certainly welcome but it must, in any case, be a pretext to justify the destruction of forests. For companies that have promised d &rsquo. exclude the deforestation of their products, the message is clear: they must not be abused by nebulous initiatives such as ""Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto"". They must, on the contrary, use their power, their influence to require aggressive actions from their suppliers d &rsquo. palm oil. Unless they want to get new clients deforestation ...

Une nomination qui intervient apr̬s celle de dirigeants de Goldman Sachs, de climato-sceptiques et autres figures peu recommandables. La d̩marche est sans ambigut̩ : il s&#8217.agit de mettre l&#8217.appareil d&#8217.tat et les autorit̩s de r̩gulation entre les mains de ceux m̻mes qui n&#8217.ont cess̩ de combattre leurs tentatives de r̩formes et parfois leur existence m̻me.Rex Tillerson, patron d&#8217.ExxonMobil, sera donc le prochain Secr̩taire d&#8217.tat am̩ricain. Sa nomination intervient un jour apr̬s celle du num̩ro deux de Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, au poste de conseiller ̩conomique de la Maison blanche. Ce ne sera jamais que le troisi̬me ancien cadre de la banque  rejoindre l&#8217.administration Trump, apr̬s Steven Mnuchin, directeur de hedge fund nomm̩ au Tr̩sor, et Steve Bannon, animateur du site d&#8217.extr̻me-droite Breitbart, lui aussi pass̩ par Goldman. Parmi les ministres que s&#8217.est choisi le nouveau pr̩sident am̩ricain, aux c̫t̩s de quelques g̩n̩raux et personnalit̩s politiques, on ne compte plus les personnalit̩s issues du secteur priv̩, g̩n̩ralement dans ses franges les plus extr̩mistes. Autre point commun ? Tous ou presque sont des milliardaires ou des multimillionaires.On connaissait le poids de l&#8217.argent dans la vie politique am̩ricaine et la puissance des lobbys  Washington. Depuis longtemps, les va-et-vient entre administration et secteur priv̩ sont monnaie courante dans la capitale am̩ricaine, comme ils le sont  Paris ou  Bruxelles. Avec la future administration Trump, une nouvelle ̩tape est toutefois franchie. Il ne s&#8217.agit plus seulement d&#8217.influencer les r̩gulations et d&#8217.entraver les tentatives de r̩forme de l&#8217.administration. Il ne s&#8217.agit plus m̻me simplement de placer quelques hommes  des positions cl̩s pour faciliter les relations entre r̩gulateurs et r̩gul̩s. Dor̩navant, les autorit̩s publiques sont confi̩es  ceux l m̻me qui ont consacr̩ leur carri̬re  les combattre.Ce sont ainsi des anciens de Goldman Sachs qui auront la main sur la r̩gulation de Wall Street, et des p̩troliers qui contr̫leront celle du secteur de l&#8217.̩nergie et la politique climatique. Mais cela ne s&#8217.arr̻te pas l. Le nouveau directeur de l&#8217.Agence de protection de l&#8217.environnement, Scott Pruitt, a engag̩ desdizaines de proc̩dures judiciairescontre cette Agence en tant que procureur de l&#8217.Oklahoma pour d̩fendre les int̩r̻ts de l&#8217.industrie p̩troli̬re. Le nouveau Secr̩taire au Travail, Andrew Puzder, est le dirigeant d&#8217.une chąne de fast-foods qui a pris publiquement position contre les r̩gulations f̩d̩rales et notamment la r̩forme du syst̬me de sant̩ du pr̩sident Obama. C&#8217.est aussi un opposant d̩termin̩ de la hausse du salaire minimal r̩clam̩e par une campagne de plus en plus vigoureuse aux tats-Unis. La Secr̩taire  l&#8217.ducation, Betsy DeVos, est uneadversaire acharn̩edes syndicats d&#8217.enseignants et de l&#8217.̩cole publique en g̩n̩ral : elle a propos̩ de remplacer celle-ci par un syst̬me de coupons distribu̩s aux familles pour payer leur ̩ducation dans des ̩coles priv̩es. Le secr̩taire  la Sant̩, Tom Price, est un opposant de longue date de l&#8217.avortement et de la contraception. Et ainsi de suite.Inutile de dire qu&#8217.avec une telle conception du gouvernement, le conflit d&#8217.int̩r̻ts devient la r̬gle plut̫t que l&#8217.exception.  commencer par ceux de Donald Trump lui-m̻me, bien sr. Mais tous ses futurs ministres sont eux aussi concern̩s. Rex Tillerson est d̩j ̩pingl̩ pour ses liens ̩troits avec la Russie et l&#8217.int̩r̻t d&#8217.ExxonMobil  une lev̩e des sanctions contre cette derni̬re, qui lui permettrait de relancer ses projets de forage dans l&#8217.Arctique. Ces probl̬mes pourraient donner lieu  de vigoureuses batailles au S̩nat, qui doit valider les nominations de Trump, et o_ les D̩mocrates gardent une minorit̩ de blocage et pourraient ̻tre rejoints par certains R̩publicains.Mais au-del m̻me de ces cas embl̩matiques, le ph̩nom̬ne s&#8217.̩tend jusqu&#8217.aux ̩chelons inf̩rieurs des administrations f̩d̩rales. La r̩v̩lation de la diffusion d&#8217.un questionnaire interrogeant les employ̩s du D̩partement de l&#8217.nergie sur leur implication dans les questions de changement climatique a ̩t̩ largement consid̩r̩e comme le signe avant-coureur d&#8217.une future chasse aux sorci̬res. Une analyse de l&#8217.ONG Public Citizen, reprise parThe Nation, montre plus globalement que l&#8217.̩quipe de transition choisie par Trump, dont le r̫le est d&#8217.identifier les quelques dizaines de cadres dirigeants qui prendront les r̻nes des agences f̩d̩rales sur le plan op̩rationnel, compte 70% de lobbyistes souvent charg̩s de d̩fendre des int̩r̻ts priv̩s contre ces m̻mes agences. On y retrouve ainsi un ancien lobbyiste de PepsiCo et le g̩ant de l&#8217.agrochimie DuPont charg̩ de s̩lectionner les futurs cadres du d̩partement de l&#8217.Agriculture.

State, l&#8217. equivalent to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: this will be Rex Tillerson, head of the oil company ExxonMobil. An appointment comes after leaders of Goldman Sachs, climate-sceptics and other unsavoury figures. The approach is unambiguous: it s&#8217. this is a l&#8217. d&#8217. State and regulatory authorities between the hands of those same n&#8217. have ceased to fight their attempts to reform and sometimes their very existence.Rex Tillerson, boss d&#8217. ExxonMobil, will be the next Secretary d&#8217. US State. His appointment came a day after the number two of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, as economic advisor White House. This will never that the third former part of the bank to join l&#8217. administration Trump, after Steven Mnuchin, director of hedge fund appointed Treasury, and Steve Bannon, Panellist site d&#8217 .extr̻me-right Breitbart, past by Goldman. Among the ministers that s&#8217 is chosen the new US president, alongside a few generals and politicians, there are more personalities from the private sector, usually in the more extremist fringes. Another common point? All or almost are billionaires or multimillionaires.We knew the weight of l&#8217. money in the American political life and power of lobbies in Washington. Since long, shuttling between administration and private sector are commonplace in the US capital, as they are in Paris or Brussels. With the future administration Trump, a new step is taken however. It s&#8217. is only d&#8217. influence regulations and d&#8217 .entraver attempts to reform l&#8217. administration. It s&#8217. this is even more simply put some men to key positions to facilitate relations between regulators and regulated. Now, public authorities are entrusted to those that who have devoted their careers to combat.This is former Goldman Sachs which will hand on the regulation of Wall Street, and that control the petroleum sector l&#8217. energy and climate policy. But it s&#8217. not stop there. The new director of l&#8217. Protection Agency l&#8217 .environnement, Scott Pruitt, engaged in desdizaines procedures judiciairescontre this Agency as Attorney l&#8217. Oklahoma to defend the interests of l&#8217. oil industry. The new Secretary of Labour, Andrew Puzder, is the leader d&#8217. a fast-food chain has taken publicly position against federal regulations including the reform of the health system of President Obama. C &#8217 is also a determined opponent of the rising minimum wage claimed by a campaign increasingly strong in the United States. The Secretary l&#8217. Education, Betsy DeVos, is uneadversaire acharn̩edes unions d&#8217 .enseignants and l&#8217. public school in general: it proposed to replace it by a system of coupons distributed to families to pay their education in private schools. The Secretary of Health, Tom Price, is a long-standing opponent of l&#8217. abortion and contraception. And so on.Needless to say qu&#8217. with such a design of the government, the conflict d&#8217. interest becomes the rule rather than l&#8217 .exception. At first those of Donald Trump, of course. But all future ministers are also concerned. Rex Tillerson is already pinned for its close ties with Russia and l&#8217. interest d&#8217. ExxonMobil to a lifting of sanctions against the latter, which would revive its drilling projects in l&#8217. Arctic. These problems could give rise to vigorous battles in the Senate, which must validate the appointments of Trump, and where the Democrats retain a blocking minority and could be joined by some Republicans.But even beyond these emblematic case, the phenomenon s&#8217. is jusqu&#8217. the lower levels of federal government. The revelation of the dissemination d&#8217. a questionnaire asking employees of the Department of l&#8217. Energy on their involvement in the issues of climate change was widely regarded as the harbinger d&#8217. a future witch hunt. An analysis of l&#8217. NGO Public Citizen, recovery Parthian Nation, shows more generally that l&#8217. transition team chosen by Trump, whose role is d&#8217. identify a few dozen executives who will take the reins of federal agencies on the operational plan, has 70% of lobbyists often responsible for defending private interests against these same agencies. There are as well a former lobbyist for PepsiCo and giant l&#8217. DuPont agrochemistry responsible for selecting future frameworks of l&#8217. Agriculture. Similarly, mostly lawyers responsible for defending their clients against procedures initiated by the Department of Justice who choose the leaders of this department. Myron Ebell, lobbyist hard climato-scepticisme, was responsible for the transition within l&#8217. Protection Agency l&#8217 .environnement.In short, if Donald Trump won the elections by campaigning on hatred of l&#8217 .establishment and elites of Washington, it may especially presiding over an unprecedented power of private interests on l&#8217. d&#8217.

She went home to Jesus nearly a decade ago and I still miss her every day. And growing up, my mother's aunt, Sister Mary Charles, a Sister of Mercy, was a beloved member of my extended family, always present for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Some of my earliest memories are from visits to her convent in Greenwich, Conn., with its life-like statues and exotic aromas  a combination of liturgical incense, burning prayer candles, soap and boiled vegetables.All of my life, religious sisters have had a special place in my heart, imagination and spiritual journey.

Bescherm de bossen: https://t.co/8MUbrdokD5;"Palm oil giant makes important promisesThere is development in our campaign around Indonesia's rainforests! IOI, one of the world's largest palm oil products, announced last week new measures. If the company implements these plans in a good way, it is a big step toward sustainable palm oil and improved working conditions for employees.In the new plans, IOI proposes, inter alia, the following objectives:This may sound like obvious policy, but since 2008, we have repeatedly shown that IOI is not attracting the impact on the environment and locals. This also applies to big competitors like Wilmar and Golden Agri.If IOI knows a new standard, these other manufacturers will have to follow. Certainly now that consumers and the food industry are increasingly asking for palm oil that is guaranteed free of rainforest destruction and human rights violations.Do you also want to make your way to the forests?BE FOREST FRIENDIOI has done good promises and broken. That's why the company was launched a year ago from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Instead of striking his hand, IOI wanted to go to court to complain about the RSPO.Inconceivably we found. And we not alone: ܉major consumer brands such as Mars, Kellog, Nestl̩ and Unilever decided not to take palm oil off IOI. With support from supporters from all over the world we came back to action in September last September. We blocked the refinery in Rotterdam at the office in Malaysia with more than 300,000 signatures.Nevertheless, we dare to be hopeful with this message. The steps that the company wants to take go beyond previous attempts. IOI also promises that it will be able to test its progress next year by an independent third party.Kiki Taufik, head of the International Greenpeace Campaign in Indonesia, therefore reacts positively: ""IOI has gone a long way over the past 12 months and is now starting to take significant action to ward off the destruction of forests and human rights violations from its trade chain. Greenpeace will keep an eye on IOI to make sure they continue. ""We want to thank everybody who made this huge breakthrough possible. It is the result of your signatures, donations and shares. The end of deforestation in Indonesia is a little closer. Of course we continue, so keep on following us.Forests are beautiful and vital for a healthy climate.

5979e6e69ad5885bf96d4321;R1636;Social;"How multinationals use climate change to impose an industrial agricultural modelGreen CapitalismGovernments are keeping an eye on the agricultural sector&#8217.s greenhouse gas emissions. A new concept is emerging: ""climate-smart agriculture,"" with the objective of producing more, better. In the arena of climate negotiations, multinational corporations are getting set to promote ""smart fertilizers"" and plants genetically modified for heat tolerance. While industrial agriculture is about to win the battle with organic agriculture, researchers and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are trying to overturn the deal.Initially published inFrench. Translated by Leslie Thatcher,Truth OutClose to a quarter of the world&#8217.s greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture[1]. A worrying figure, and a disturbing one since it includes all agricultural systems of production, from ""conventional"" agriculture to organic agriculture, from battery farming to pasturing, from industrial monocultures to small, mixed farms. While farmers are blamed for their responsibility in climate change, actors from industrial agriculture take advantage of these conflations to greenwash their image.That&#8217.s the case of Yara International, a Norwegian company and leader in synthetic fertilizers that in 2014 sold more than 26 tons of fertilizer in 150 countries[2]. The group is throwing itself into ""sustainable intensification."" Its idea? Increased use of chemical fertilizers will increase productivity and thus allow less area to be under cultivation and avoid those emissions linked to the expansion of cultivation to now-forested areas.This argument has not convinced the agricultural NGO Grain, which, in anew report, emphasizes that fertilizer manufacturers figure ""among the primary enemies of the climate at a global level."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reckons that for every 100 kilos of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the ground, one kilo turns up in the atmosphere in the form of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. ""Their products could be responsible for close to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions without even mentioning the damage brought about to waterways, soils and the ozone layer,"" adds the NGO, a discrepancy between its walk and its talk that earns Yara a nomination for the Prix Pinocchio du climat (climate Pinocchio prize) 2015[3].The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) does not share that opinion: It considers sustainable intensification a ""smart"" solution in confronting climate change. In spite of the criticisms formulated by NGOs, Yara is one of the multinationals that have recently joined theGlobal Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture(GACSA), whichassemblescountries, environmental conservation NGOs, universities and research centers[4]. The concept of climate-smart agriculture is based on three pillars. First of all, the FAO explains, it&#8217.s a matter of increasing agricultural productivity to confront the increase in global population, then of ""adapting agricultural systems"" to cope with extreme climate events likely to increase, such as floods and droughts. The third pillar is the implementation of agricultural practices that ""reduce"" greenhouse gas emissions.Basta!has plunged into the guide to ""climate-smart"" initiatives[5]. On the menu of miracle cures: herbicide-tolerant rapeseed that allows the use of ""fewer and ever less toxic chemical products,"" and drought-tolerant corn, which would increase yields by ""20 to 30 percent"" - assertions that the Inf&#8217.OGM organizationdisputes. In September 2015, a hundred organizationssigned an appealthat rebukes GACSA for its failure to specify the criteria that would allow a definition of what may, or may not, qualify as a ""smart response"" to climate change.""There&#8217.s been no work on defining the criteria for climate-smart agriculture because defining would result in excluding existing agricultural practices,"" said Jeanne-Maureen Jorand of CCFD-Terre Solidaire. ""Meanwhile, without norms or criteria of exclusion, this concept is quite simply dangerous.""""Defining climate-smart agriculture was a red line for the French government,"" Jorand said. During the launch of GACSA, Annick Girardin, [French] secretary of state for the development of Francophonie, warned against the risks of certain practices such as GMOs or recourse to fuel crops. ""We must be vigilant not to support everything in the name of the struggle against climate disorder and to assure that the solutions we put in place do not create more problems than they resolve,"" she declared in September 2014. The French government finally decided to join GACSA along with 21 other countries, explaining to AFP that it wanted ""to be inside rather than outside, to have an influence.""That&#8217.s also the position of certain research organizations, such as theCenter for International Cooperation in Agronomic Research for Development(CIRAD)[6]. ""The definition is not sufficiently rigorous, which leaves the door open for different ways of intensifying and for a vision of a more industrial agriculture,"" said Emmanuel Torquebiau, climate change task force director at CIRAD. ""We&#8217.re fighting within GACSA to assert our perspective.""""We&#8217.re proposing scientific studies that would allow us to verify what falls within ecological climate-smart agriculture and what is greenwashing,"" Torquebiau added. ""It&#8217.s a matter of staying within these networks to put some science in there, because there&#8217.s a lot of smoke screens.""CIRAD, which works mainly with countries in the global South, encourages ecological agricultural practices, such as permanent ground cover in order to increase organic matter, trap carbon dioxide and limit recourse to fertilizers. INRA, the National Institute for Agricultural Research, also a GACSA member,encouragesagroforestry, for example, by planting ""cereal grains under trees to better resist dryness.""However, the battle between agroecology and industrial agriculture is strongly tilted within the alliance, which contains a strong private sector representation. In addition to active members such as Danone, the alliance contains the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which includes many multinationals. According to the NGOs, about 60 percent of GACSA members are from the fertilizer private sector[7].. Emblematic of their strategy, Walmart, the world leader in retail distribution, wants to reduce emissions by associating its suppliers with the ""fertilizer optimization"" programs developed by Yara[8].Concretely, the orange plantations of PepsiCo, a Walmart supplier, must now use Yara&#8217.s nitrogen fertilizers labeled ""low-carbon footprint."" Supposed to lead to less runoff, these fertilizers aim to ""avoid a situation where only organically produced food would gain the climate brand of approval,"" explains Yara.Invited last March to the third meeting for climate-smart agriculture in Montpellier, French Minister of Agriculture St̩phane Le Foll emphasized that soils can act as ""carbon sinks.""""The more you increase organic matter in your soils, the more you store greenhouse gas,"" he said. ""Moreover, you increase yields!""The government has launched an international research program entitled ""4 for 1,000."" By increasing the soil&#8217.s carbon-stocking capacity by 0.4 percent per year through the implementation of certain not-yet-defined agricultural practices, this project strives to absorb and store 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and, in addition, to restore depleted croplands, notably in the arid and near-arid zones of the African continent.""Given the figures I&#8217.ve made public,"" Le Foll said, ""the stakes more than justify the risk - and would also warrant that we finance tomorrow&#8217.s techniques, developments and production models through the carbon market."" If it succeeds, the 4 for 1,000 project could also become a tool for compensating for private companies&#8217. greenhouse gas emissions, along the lines of Air France&#8217.s project in the forests of Madagascar. ""Carbon finance and financial investors are entrusted with a central role,"" the association Attac and the Conf̩d̩ration Paysanne [Peasant Confederation] deplore in a common memorandum on climate-smart agriculture. ""Yet these measures have demonstrated their ineffectiveness and inability to generate a post-carbon transition. There&#8217.s no reason why it should be any different in agriculture.""A few days before the opening of COP21, civil society organizations asked governments not to recognize ""climate-smart agriculture"" as a possible solution to climate change, a position shared by the [French] secretary of state for the development of Francophonie who insisted in September 2014 that GACSA ""not come interfere and interject itself into the climate negotiations."" Contacted by Basta!, the [French] Agriculture Ministry emphasized that climate-smart agriculture could appear on the ""solutions agenda,"" a text assembling the commitments of non-state actors, which could appear alongside the agreement negotiated in Paris.""The 4 for 1,000 initiative already appears in that agenda,"" Jeanne-Maureen Jorand said. A roundtable on low-carbon technologies (LCPTI), sponsored by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and supported by the French government, also appears on the agenda. Among those invited to this roundtable figures none other than - Monsanto!""It&#8217.s a catastrophe,"" Jorand said. ""The government is in the process of institutionalizing this agenda of solutions and of validating climate-smart agriculture without any criteria and without any discussion."" Questioned on this topic, the Agriculture Ministry declined to comment.Sophie Chapelle&mdash.Photo:  CC Malcolm Carlaw[1]In an assessment published in April 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) deems that greenhouse gas emissions related to agriculture, forestry and fisheries represent 10 to 12 gigatons equivalent carbon dioxide, or 24 percent of global emissions.[3]""The objective of the Prix Pinocchio du Climat is to illustrate and denounce the negative impacts of multinational companies and especially those that whitewash themselves with &#8217.green&#8217. talk.""[4]This alliance was launched in September 2014, during the New York climate summit, by the World Bank, the CGIAR (a consulting group for international agricultural research) and the FAO.[6]Member of the AllianceCIRAD organizedthe third international conference on climate-smart agriculture in Montpellier, March 16-18, 2015.[7]This over-representation is assured through professional alliances such as the International Association of Fertilization Industries or the ""Fertilizer Institute"" of which Yara is a member[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]";

"" Advocates-, visibly shocked, unable to say more.But the purchase of Dia has been a failure. At the time, the former CEO, Georges (CARR.PA) had predicted the end of the discount. In months, the group had then engaged in a broad investment plan for renovating aging stores, modernize and place them under the Carrefour. Today, the losses generated by this strategy amounted to 150 million euros, believes the CGT. "" We felt that the group was right in the wall, tackle Philippe Allard, the CGT delegate group. Clients have finally deserting some stores because of price too high. They prefer today go to Lidl "".A Colombes, the faithful Carrefour Contact yet not appear to have been shocked by this difference. ""In Carrefour, prices were perhaps a little more senior but there was more choice at the time of dia"", reported Ferroudja, a quadra. ""There was all, people were kind to the fund,"" said Pierrette wondered, quite annoyed, where it can continue to do in foot races. A Colombes, the choice is not yet. "" In the neighbourhood, there is a Leclerc, a Franprix, a Monoprix, a Carrefour Market, reassures alongside Francis, another client, which has already made its choice. So, I'm in Franprix!

Wilmar's commitment to Zero Deforestation has the potential to transform the controversial palm oil industry. """"Wilmar's policy indicates that this sector has a big problem, and while this policy is good news for forests and tigers, its success will be judged by Wilmar's actions to implement and enforce it.Our challenge to Wilmar is: will now immediately stop buying sources from companies like Dual Group, closely linked to Wilmar and involved in forest clearance, illegal peatland development and social conflict? ""Over the past seven years, Greenpeace has repeatedly exposed Wilmar's role in the dirty acts of forest destruction, extracting natural resources from national parks, destroying major tiger habitats, buying sources from suppliers associated with 'orangutan' cemeteries or forest fires this year in Sumatra .""Over the years, the company including Wilmar, has been hiding behind the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), Greenpeace will monitor how Wilmar put these words into action, and will immediately welcome the end of Wilmar's trade with all the companies that Involved in deforestation.The challenge was thrown into other palm oil traders such as Cargill, Musim Mas, and Sime Darby to issue a similar policy, ""Bustar added.The palm oil sector is the single biggest cause of deforestation in Indonesia. A map from the Ministry of Forestry shows that Indonesia loses 620,000 ha of rain forests annually between 2009-2011 (an area larger than Brunei size).

597a05d5d848472c164d1b5f;R1873;HS;"CommentsSojo Community Comment CovenantThe brouhaha surrounding Paula Deen, the Food Network staraccused of tolerating a racist atmospherein the kitchen of one of her restaurants, has sent my scapegoat antennae vibrating. Folks are lining up on opposite sides of the issue, to either defend or condemn this Queen of a Southern cooking financial empire. Dropped by the Food Network, Smithfield Foods, andnow Walmart, and with a Facebook page populated by supporters, Paula Deen۪s accusers and defenders are facing off like battalions on a battlefield. Extreme polarization like this is a symptom that scapegoating is underway, so I suggest everyone take a deep breath and back away from the deep fat fryer while I offer a few scapegoating observations.The Verdict is Already InPolarization is not about a search for truth. Polarization indicates that each side believes it is in possession of the truth and is running on overdrive, panting with the effort of making their accusation stick. Paula Deen is a racist!۝ shout her accusers. Why do you hate Southerners?۝ counter her defenders. No matter which side you are on, you are steadfastly, undeniably certain that you are in the possession of the truth and on the side of good.Outrage is Perceived to be a Moral NecessityPolarization is almost always accompanied by outrage. Under these conditions, being outraged by another۪s behavior is a clear indication of your moral pedigree. Only someone so dedicated to truth and justice would feel the depth of outrage you feel at the morally reprehensible behavior of your opponents. Of course, both sides feel outraged so we find the opponents locked in mortal combat: the only satisfactory outcome is the total defeat of your opponent. Good must conquer evil, and you will not rest until you have fulfilled your moral obligation.Guilty or Not, the Accused is a ScapegoatPolarization accompanied by outrage is a clear indication that the accused is functioning as a scapegoat for both sides. Two truths are being concealed here. the first one we already indicated. Determining the truth of whether Paula Deen is actually a racist is not even on the table. Pre-deciding the truth about Paula was a pre-requisite for the combat. But the second truth being concealed has to do with the polarized opposites. By insisting on their own predetermined goodness, neither side needs to ask themselves whether they are behaving badly. No self-examination required here because, as with Paula, determining the truth about our own behavior is not even on the table. We are pre-judged by our own righteous indignation as steadfastly, undeniably good.Scapegoat du JourThat۪s the function of a scapegoat: to establish our identity as good people over and against some evil other. With the bad guys clearly determined, the scapegoaters give themselves a free pass. They conveniently avoid having to answer uncomfortable questions such as: HaveIever used a racial slur or laughed at a racial joke? DoIstereotype racial or cultural groups? AmIprejudiced in ways that I am currently blind to? In what ways doIbenefit from the systemic racism in America today? The Paula Deen scandal is currently providing just such an avoidance mechanism for the polarized, outraged critics and fans who will be sorry to see the frenzy die down. But it will. Paula۪s predicament will fade from the scene and she will re-emerge months or years from now reborn and rehabilitated. Most of us will hardly remember all the fuss because we will have already moved on to the next juicy scandal, renewing our sense of ourselves as good while avoiding a fresh set of uncomfortable questions with the next scapegoat du jour.Suzanne Rossblogs at theRaven Foundation, where she uses mimetic theory to provide social commentary on religion, politics, and pop culture.
