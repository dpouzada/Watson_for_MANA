BUT NOT WE news Our values Our Carve our information on social networks Forests September 27, 2016 In recent years, millions of hectares of forest and peatlands have been destroyed for the culture of oil palm, the  Expense of biodiversity, climate and local populations. According to a study published this month, more than 100 000 people died prematurely in 2015 alone in Southeast Asia because of toxic fumes related to deforestation. &#013. The forest fires, a scourge gigantic. Forest Fires in Kalimantan. D &rsquo. after our research, almost half of forest fires and bogs found in 2015 in the regions of Riau and West Kalimantan (Borneo) were located in concessions palm oil or trees to pulp.  North of Kalimantan, 48% of these fires were located in concessions palm oil. Children, without any respiratory protection, play in a court d &rsquo. school in Kalimantan, while the toxic fumes of forest fires are not yet resolved. The Indonesian government believes that 1, 7 million hectares &#8211. a surface barely smaller than the Wales, went to smoke 2015, for a rejection of CO2 in the atmosphere above all emissions United Kingdom for one year ().  In 25 years, Indonesia has lost a quarter of its tropical forest, one of the most important and most valuable in the world. It is clear today that producers of palm oil must respond to these fires: no matter who lit the flame, the clearing and drainage of peatlands. to plant palm oil and other industrial species, which establish the conditions conducive to fires. Forest Fires between two concessions d &rsquo. IOI To address this scourge environmental and health, the Indonesian government is committed to force companies to restore the plots destroyed by the fires.  And many hundreds of thousands of us have been pressing for major brands such as Colgate strengthen their policies Zero Deforestation. While significant progress is observed in the sector palm oil, some dealers are lagging behind.  This is particularly the case of IOC-UNESCO, a giant palm oil based in Malaysia, which is striving for almost a decade to make promises for the break immediately.  She is one of the biggest importers of palm oil in Europe and provided, in the past, brands such as Nestlé and Unilever.  If it is difficult to always draw precisely the palm oil, that produced by IOI is undeniably present in toothpastes and biscuits that we consume. For the moment, IOI is fate remaining discrete.  Al &rsquo. reverse companies turn directly to the consumer and must therefore &rsquo. s adapt to the requirements of the general public, IOI has no mark to defend public and operates in the shadow: 87 followers on Twitter.  Yet IOI is probably one of the worst companies you have never heard. IOI and deforestation, it is a long history.  Greenpeace has revealed his involvement in the deforestation of the region of Kalimantan in 2008.  Since then, IOC-UNESCO has converted tens of thousands of hectares in plantations palm oil &#8211. including habitat areas of a species of orangutan today threatened.  Moreover, it continues to buy palm oil companies deforesting. Survey Greenpeace on the ground.  Here recently deforested land. It also ignores the risk of fire associated with drainage bogs, which once dried are rendered extremely flammable.  The fires are a boon to farmers: they cleared forested areas and make fertile for their industrial plantations.  The Indonesian government tries to solve this problem by requiring companies to restore the plots burned.  She seems not yet received the logs: in 2016, members of Greenpeace visited a plantation company and found evidence that palm oil had been planted () in areas recently burned. She has always known violent social conflict.  The Long Teran Kanan (EN), a Malaysian community whose land has been taken by IOI in 1996 and converted to plantations palm oil, has tried to recognize its rights for six years. The company has also been accused of abuse on its employees (. &#8211. as the confiscation of their passports and the exercise of pressure to prevent them from syndicate.  Many of them have also testified that IOC-UNESCO paid well below the legal minimum wage. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (CPSR), a ""roundtable"" bringing together companies palm oil plantations but also consuming businesses and NGOs, is supposed to verify that those who claim this label set up sustainability policies concrete and effective.  But it is very serious. While she knows the IOI practices for years, the CPSR waited April this year for the exclude ... before the return in August, even before IOC-UNESCO makes anything to repair the damage which it is responsible. Today, it is quite possible, by applying the methodology HCS recognized and implementation by a growing number of industry players, to produce palm oil Zero Deforestation.  That is why we are today a action to ask IOI totally change its practices: several of our activists, with l &rsquo. using our ship Esperanza, blocked this morning goods IOI in the port of Rotterdam, Holland.

This is evidenced by Greenpeace's research. Nutricia, part of the French Danone, buys the packaging paper at Asia Pulp & amp. Paper (APP). This paper company is notorious for the large-scale destruction of the rainforest in Indonesia.Undercover investigation at the pulp mill at Sumatra shows that APP systematically violates the Indonesian law. The ramin tree, protected by the Indonesian law and CITES, the UN Convention for the Protection of Endangered Species, is mixed by APP with plantation wood and milled in the pulp mill. Since the 2001 ban on bananas, APP has capped more than 180,000 hectares of cattle in Indonesia, where the tree prevails. Feather areas not only contain a lot of CO2, but are also the habitats of the almost extinct Sumatran tiger. Only 400 of these tigers live in the wild.""We caught APP on the scene. This company claims that it carries out a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to illegally harvested wood, but that's nonsense, ""says Bustar Maitar, campaign leader forest at Greenpeace Indonesia.

According to Unilever, the most famous Eismarke ' Langnese&# 8217. here, the consumers but despite its palm oil without remorse eat their ice cream.  Since 2012 Unilever uses palm oil from certified sources such as the RSPO, the round table on sustainable palm oil.

Confusing trading palm oil from illegally cleared land in RSPO-certified products and will be ""laundered.""  For years, there are indications that the already weak constraints of members are not complied with.  In recent weeks, for example, the violation of standards by RSPO members for headlines.  Theoretically, the RSPO writes, for example, that the communities involved regarding the sale of their country within the framework of a free, timely and informed consultation.  In practice, this right to self-determination but regularly undermined by RSPO members. Photo: Grodotzki/Neugebauer/Robin Wood In the name of Wilmar International falls again and again in this context.  And that, although Wilmar, at least on paper to comply with social and environmental standards.  Wilmar is RSPO member since 2005 and controls about 45% of global palm oil trade.  ROBIN WOOD, has several times in the past few years of human rights abuses and land grabs by Wilmar.  So, for example, about the forced evacuation of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on the nearby village of Sungai Beruang by the security forces of Wilmer, in August 2011 .. Now show reports of NGO People Forest Program that Wilmar also in West Sumatra has brought communities by unfair means for their country. In 2014 there was a complaint against a branch company of the palm oil company.  The accused PT Permata Hijau Pasaman, 1, from the Minangkabau community behind their backs and their country without approval and subsequent protests with the help of a probably bribed or influenced by local police to suppress.  A village head was detained without formal charges for several months.  Several others were interrogated and pressured. A similar land rights conflict took place last year in Kalimantan (Borneo) between villagers and a supplier of Wilmar (PT.SMP).  PT.SMP had unlawfully and without the consent of the county town of surfaces and taken possession of.  Also, slashing and burning, both against RSPO standards and the Indonesian law.  Protests by the community were resolved with the help of the police.  Some villagers were arrested.  Although the concessions for the remaining land, PM.SMP its transforms into palm oil plantations.  Local NGOs have now submitted a complaint to the RSPO.  Because consequences be drawn, but it is rather doubtful.  Complaints are usually long disappeared in RSPO.  So far, chilling consequences for RSPO members. Langnese ice cream from Wilmar-Palmöl?  No thank you! Wood For questions you can contact us via ::Robin.

Deforestation and drainage of peatlands are widely recognized as the root cause of the fire crisis, including by the Indonesian government.

The third is owned by Alas Kusuma Group, where several companies of this group hold the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certificate.Greenpeace calls on all companies to open their concession data more transparently and publicly available and announce measures to be taken to protect forests and peatlands and ensure they do not contribute to the ensuing fire crisis. The RSPO should also call on its members to publish concession maps, in accordance with the results of a resolution approved at the RSPO conference two years ago.These cases expose systemic failures by the Indonesian plantation sector to end deforestation. The measures taken by the company are not yet strong enough to stop their suppliers from destroying forests and peatlands. Greenpeace therefore calls on commodity traders and palm oil buyers and pulp companies from Indonesia to cooperate in broadly banning industry against deforestation and peatland clearing, including disconnecting third-party suppliers that still violate them.Annisa continued,Some time ago, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has promised to ban the opening of new peatlands, including those already licensed. [4] Greenpeace appealed to the President that this new policy be fully implemented by the company and overseen by the government. The legal framework for the new policy is needed and supported by the transparency of data related to mapping of forest cover, peatland and land ownership.

Do you know that the people of Indonesia and Southeast Asia should suffer prolonged because of the smoke of forest fires - We can not wait any longer. Now is the time to protect our forests instead of looting and destroying them.The fire again burns Indonesia's forests, devouring millions of hectares of forests and peatlands into ashes, endangered species such as the increasingly dark orangutans of the future.Smoke also has besieged Singapore, Malaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the naughty palm oil industry actually pours fuel to make the crisis more uncontrollable by draining peatlands and clearing forests.One source of this crisis is the Malaysian palm oil exporter: IOI is still actively taking chances in the midst of smoke and forest destruction crisis and hopes the world will turn a blind eye.

The company manages oil palm plantations and processes palm oil for the food industry as well as for the production of biofuels. Wilmar accounts for 45 percent of world trade with palm oil and is one of the largest growers of palm oil in Indonesia and Malaysian Borneo. According to Greenpeace and other environmental organizations, Wilmar is the company that has been responsible for the most extensive rainforest blast in Indonesia in recent years. In Uganda, Wilmars oil palm plantations have destroyed forests rich in biodiversity and expelled small farmers from their land, usually without compensation or other livelihoods.In 2016, Amnesty International found serious human rights violations on seven palm oil plantations operated by Wilmar in Indonesia, including children between 8 and 14 years performing heavy and dangerous work, systematic discrimination against women and parakat use A very toxic herbicide, without protective equipment. Wilmar sells the oil to nine global companies, such as Unilever, Nestlé and Procter & Gamble.After hard criticism, Wilmar adopted a policy against deforestation in 2013. But it remains to be seen whether it will be transformed into subcontractors and remedies for the damage caused by the company to people and the environment. The AP funds - which had large holdings in the company even before the policy was adopted - did not have an impact dialogue with the company.The AP funds also invest SEK 89.5 million in Malaysian Sime Darby, one of the world's largest palm oil companies. In 2009, they signed a 63-year lease agreement with the Liberian state, which would give them access to over 311,000 hectares of land, & # 8211. An area as large as Gotland. Cultivations have begun without consultation with affected villages, which company is obliged to do according to international regulations. Locals have been expelled and received insufficient or no compensation for their land, and important forest land has been destroyed. Large-scale investments in land have increased dramatically in Liberia and now cover around 25 percent of the country's surface.Soybean in South America is a threat to grasslands, savannah and forests, such as the artistic area of ​​Chaco in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia and the so-called Cerradon in Brazil. Cerradon holds about 5 percent of the world's biodiversity and represents an important source of water for all of South America. The expansion of soy crops has also led to forced migration of locals.The AP funds have invested SEK 415 million in the agricultural companies Archer Daniels Midland and 200 million Bunge, two giants dominating world trade with soy. Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge are committed to not buying soy that caused the Amazon's wreckage. However, companies do not have a corresponding policy for other areas with high biodiversity. Without commitment from these influential actors, no pressure is created on growers to prevent further conversion of valuable ecosystems into agricultural land. The AP funds have not had any dialogue to influence the companies.The Great Palm Oil Scandal & # 8211.

According to Greenpeace Indonesia Forest Campaigner Yuyun Indardi in the interim period the company needs to map out the supply and all of the peat landscapes impacted by their operations and their suppliers. Yuyun explained, based on Greenpace search, the company is known to get the supply of palm oil from plantation companies that have a bad record on the environment and human rights. &quot.They have to do a moratorium and also do landscaping for example in a landscape and invite anyone involved to do the same thing in order to be transparent and we all can see whether what is done is true or not for the sake of nature improvement,&quot. he told reporters in the region Wahid Hasyim, Jakarta, Tuesday (27/09/2016). Greenpeace calls IOI partner companies such as Austindo Nusantara Jaya, Korindo and Indofood to deforest primary forests in Papua and Kalimantan. In addition, the company and its partners are also proven to exploit workers including employing minors. This practice said Yuyun found on Eagle High and Indofood. &quot.The company and its third party have been proven to develop the gardens on peatlands, uncontrollable wildfires including the deliberate use of fire in deforestation, the latter, human rights abuses including building gardens without FPIC with indigenous or local communities and widespread use of military apparatus And armed police in the field, &quot.he added. On the other hand, he said, Greenpace also urged the Indonesian Government to be consistent in law enforcement, especially against companies that are still in violation. Moreover, said Yuyun, IOI had previously been sanctioned by the revocation of membership of Roundable Sustainable Palm Oil RSPO. &quot.IOI and its third party are not improving, the IOI scandal list is getting longer and neglected.&quot. Human rights violations and arson are intentionally still going on to date. As a result Yuyun said, the activity produced a smoke disaster and harmful consequences for Indonesia and neighboring countries. &quot.The IOI has failed to take action on the most basic inspection results of its suppliers, while promising that palm oil is clean - well-known brands that continue to buy from IOI will be at great risk,&quot. he concluded. KBR believes the readers of this site are intelligent and educated people. So let&#39.s use polite words in this comment field. Courteous sentence, away from SARA prejudices (tribe, religion, race and intergroup), will surely be more heard. Let&#39.s practice it! Mudik seemed to be an annual routine in welcoming Eid al-Fitr.

The moratorium applies to &ograve. only to land controlled by the Indonesian Ministry of Forests and not interested in those controlled by the regional government or the forest areas forming part of concessions already &agrave. existing, leaving then without protection million hectares of forest and peat bogs.The announcement of the Indonesian government &egrave. arrived the day after the launch of the report diGreenpeace ""Final countdown"", which denounces the destruction of 130,000 hectares of rainforest since 2015, 40% of them in Papua, one of the regions most &ugrave. rich in biodiversit &agrave. of the planet. The report also reveals how important twenty-five of palm oil producers are responsible not only to deforestation, illegal extension of their plantations and fires, but also of exploitation of workers. Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Hershey's, Kellogg's, Kraft Heinz, The CW, Mars, Mondelez, Nestl &eacute., PepsiCo, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever have purchased palm oil by at least twenty of these producers.In 2013, Greenpeace International had revealed cheWilmar-giant of sour business and main operator of palm oil in the world-and its suppliers eranoresponsabilidella deforestation, fires in peat bogs and the massive destruction of the habitat of the Sumatran tiger. At the end of that year, the multinational announced unaambiziosa politicadi ""no-deforestazione, no-destruction of peatlands and no-exploitation of workers"". But, as we read in the new report, Wilmar continues to buy palm oil from at least 18 suppliers who destroy the forests and expropriated land to the community &agrave. local.To protest against this inconsistency, September 25, 2018 thirty of Greenpeace activists have blocked a tanker carrying palm oil and they occupied a refinery property &agrave. Wilmar. The refinery, located on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the palm oil works of three of the producers mentioned in the report ""Final Countdown"" because &eacute. guilty of the destruction of rain forests are on the Indonesian islands of Kalimantan and Papua. On these islands live endangered species to extinction, like the orangutans and the birds of paradise.Unfortunately, Wilmar not &egrave. the exception. Between 2010 and 2015, the main suppliers of palm oil and numerous multinational companies that use this matter before they committed to remove from your supply chain deforestation, the destruction of peatlands and the violation of rights of workers and the community &agrave. local.

Although there &ograve., the destruction of Indonesian rain forests, because of the expansion of palm plantations from oil, showed no signs of slowing down.For these reasons we ask again to respect and enforce companies to their suppliers, plans to achieve by 2020 to stop the destruction of forests in Indonesia before it's too late.

BUT NOT WE news Our values Our Carve our information on social networks Forests September 27, 2016 In recent years, millions of hectares of forest and peatlands have been destroyed for the culture of oil palm, the  Expense of biodiversity, climate and local populations. According to a study published this month, more than 100 000 people died prematurely in 2015 alone in Southeast Asia because of toxic fumes related to deforestation. &#013. The forest fires, a scourge gigantic. Forest Fires in Kalimantan. D &rsquo. after our research, almost half of forest fires and bogs found in 2015 in the regions of Riau and West Kalimantan (Borneo) were located in concessions palm oil or trees to pulp.  North of Kalimantan, 48% of these fires were located in concessions palm oil. Children, without any respiratory protection, play in a court d &rsquo. school in Kalimantan, while the toxic fumes of forest fires are not yet resolved. The Indonesian government believes that 1, 7 million hectares &#8211. a surface barely smaller than the Wales, went to smoke 2015, for a rejection of CO2 in the atmosphere above all emissions United Kingdom for one year ().  In 25 years, Indonesia has lost a quarter of its tropical forest, one of the most important and most valuable in the world. It is clear today that producers of palm oil must respond to these fires: no matter who lit the flame, the clearing and drainage of peatlands. to plant palm oil and other industrial species, which establish the conditions conducive to fires. Forest Fires between two concessions d &rsquo. IOI To address this scourge environmental and health, the Indonesian government is committed to force companies to restore the plots destroyed by the fires.  And many hundreds of thousands of us have been pressing for major brands such as Colgate strengthen their policies Zero Deforestation. While significant progress is observed in the sector palm oil, some dealers are lagging behind.  This is particularly the case of IOC-UNESCO, a giant palm oil based in Malaysia, which is striving for almost a decade to make promises for the break immediately.  She is one of the biggest importers of palm oil in Europe and provided, in the past, brands such as Nestlé and Unilever.  If it is difficult to always draw precisely the palm oil, that produced by IOI is undeniably present in toothpastes and biscuits that we consume. For the moment, IOI is fate remaining discrete.  Al &rsquo. reverse companies turn directly to the consumer and must therefore &rsquo. s adapt to the requirements of the general public, IOI has no mark to defend public and operates in the shadow: 87 followers on Twitter.  Yet IOI is probably one of the worst companies you have never heard. IOI and deforestation, it is a long history.  Greenpeace has revealed his involvement in the deforestation of the region of Kalimantan in 2008.  Since then, IOC-UNESCO has converted tens of thousands of hectares in plantations palm oil &#8211. including habitat areas of a species of orangutan today threatened.  Moreover, it continues to buy palm oil companies deforesting. Survey Greenpeace on the ground.  Here recently deforested land. It also ignores the risk of fire associated with drainage bogs, which once dried are rendered extremely flammable.  The fires are a boon to farmers: they cleared forested areas and make fertile for their industrial plantations.  The Indonesian government tries to solve this problem by requiring companies to restore the plots burned.  She seems not yet received the logs: in 2016, members of Greenpeace visited a plantation company and found evidence that palm oil had been planted () in areas recently burned. She has always known violent social conflict.  The Long Teran Kanan (EN), a Malaysian community whose land has been taken by IOI in 1996 and converted to plantations palm oil, has tried to recognize its rights for six years. The company has also been accused of abuse on its employees (. &#8211. as the confiscation of their passports and the exercise of pressure to prevent them from syndicate.  Many of them have also testified that IOC-UNESCO paid well below the legal minimum wage. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (CPSR), a ""roundtable"" bringing together companies palm oil plantations but also consuming businesses and NGOs, is supposed to verify that those who claim this label set up sustainability policies concrete and effective.  But it is very serious. While she knows the IOI practices for years, the CPSR waited April this year for the exclude ... before the return in August, even before IOC-UNESCO makes anything to repair the damage which it is responsible. Today, it is quite possible, by applying the methodology HCS recognized and implementation by a growing number of industry players, to produce palm oil Zero Deforestation.  That is why we are today a action to ask IOI totally change its practices: several of our activists, with l &rsquo. using our ship Esperanza, blocked this morning goods IOI in the port of Rotterdam, Holland.

These plans come after asinvestigações the organizaçãoMighty Earthe newspaper britânicoThe Guardian, which revealed the extension dadestruição of forests and protected areas of the two countries, driven by the chocolate industry. &#8220 . A large amount docacau used in chocolate produced by Mars, Nestle, Hershey&# 8217 . s, Godiva and other major chocolate companies was cultivated ilegalmente&#8221 ., concluded the researchers, which also warned that, if no preventive measures are taken, Until 2030, the Ivory Coast will lose all their forests. The investigations brought to light the fact that some authorities costa-marfinenses corrupt are accepting huge bribes to allow small farmers to cut and burn protected forests in order to grow cocoa in them. This is also lead to the emergence of towns and villages with thousands of inhabitants within national parks.The illegally produced cocoa is later purchased by brokers and sold to large cocoa merchants, such as Barry Callebaut, Olam and Cargill, registered providers such as Cadbury, aMars and Nestle.According to aMighty Earth, the measures planned by governments are promising, but will not be successful if cocoa merchants and chocolate manufacturers not to invest in this effort. &#8220 . The great danger now is that the industry will postpone making a decision and blame the governments of Ghana and Ivory Coast, making them resolve the problem without giving a sufficient financial contribution. But who has the money and technical resources to resolve this is the indústria&#8221 ., said Etelle Higonnet, author of relatório&#8220 . The Dark Secret of Chocolate&# 8221 . daMighty Earth.The jornalThe Guardiancontactou brands Mars, Hershey Company and Mondelez to know their positions, but these not confirmed if they invest money in the plans of governments.According to the project plan Ivory Coast, these merchants take, each, responsibility for some protected forests degraded, organizing farmers to replant trees at the same time that these grow cocoa in your shadow. This is a more sustainable way of cultivating cocoa than the current, where producers cut old trees to ensure that your cacueiros have a lot of light.Some forests costa-marfinenses win national park status and one of these parks, the Marahoué, you can lose your status for being in such bad conditions.Ghana's plans include a commitment to end the new deforestation operations and transparency in the supply chain, among other measures.It is clear who will finance the plans of the two countries. The Ivory Coast expects other merchants to pay, but would not specify what the consequences if they refused. Moreover still the problem of communities that have settled in protected areas &#8211 . the government has been accused of human rights violations by thousands of cocoa producers have evicted the national park Mont Péko.Cocoa prices in both countries fell a third in the past year and Ghana's economy has been affected by lower gold prices and petróleo.Os monitoring efforts and reforestation will be very costly and the country will have difficulty in finance.For Etelle Higonnet, is clear : companies and chocolate marketers must pay. &#8220 . companies need to pay for the planting of trees in the next year. They will have, probably, profits of four thousand million, porqueo price of chocolate bars remained the same but the price of cocoa is the colapsar&#8221 ., said. &#8220 . Therefore, what they can do with this extra money ? Well, you can use it to plant trees. &#8221 . There is still concern that, with the largest restrictiveness in West Africa, companies transfer trade to other regions, such as Amazon, Central Africa and Southeast Asia. &#8220 . continue to reproduce the same disasters that we saw in West Africa unless we protect these forests agora&#8221 ., told investigadora.1ª Photo : WWF Subscribe to Newsletter Ial Ial Environment, Chocolate, Ivory Coast, deforestation, Ghana, Nestle, 1ª Photo : WWF Environment, Chocolate, Ivory Coast, deforestation, Ghana, Nestle

Unfortunately, RSPO has never been able to ensure a truly responsible production of palm oil, because of his standards a little ambitious.  Within the RSPO, in fact, there are also companies that are not able to demonstrate the absence of practices such as the fire of forest peatlands or other type of deforestation in its productive sector.  What happened recently confirms our doubts about the RSPO. At the end of March 2016, the IOIQuote Group, was reported and suspended the same RSPO as responsible for the destruction of forests and peatlands in West Kalimantan, in Indonesia.  Greenpeace has therefore asked the multinational buying palm oil from IOIQualifier to suspend the trade relations with the group.  In the months after about two dozen companies (including Ferrero, Nestle, Kellogg's, Unilever, Mars and Cargill) have listened to our request. In early August, RSPO has, however, decided to revoke the suspension of the Group IOIQualifier without this had made significant improvements.  This decision has unfortunately proved that RSPO is more interested in helping one of the founders to find their customers, and the respect of their standard. The Malaysian giant continues to drain the bogs around their concessions in Ketapang, in the south of the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan.  IOIQualifier has not yet published a global plan to ensure that their suppliers don't destroy the rainforest and the peat bogs and, not least, he didn't do nothing concrete for the respect for the rights of traditional communities of the Long Teran Kanan in Sarawak, east Malaysia. These communities for years denouncing the harassment of IOIQualifier. That's why we keep asking businesses in the palm oil sector not to resume the trade with IOIQualifier.  Regardless of the status of the certification RSPO, IOIBlocking continues to not apply policies 'No Deforestazione' and buy palm oil from this company would make an accessory your company and its customers of the destruction of forests of heaven and the violation of rights of traditional communities and workers. The decision to resume the trade with IOIBlocking should be only when the Malaysian giant is willing to take significant measures to :-maps and boundaries of their concessions, including its ratings HCV (High Value Retention) and HCS (High Stock of Carbon) .-the full list of their suppliers and the conformity of the latter with the new ambitious policies of society.

Johnson and Pepsico, accomplices of deforestation in Indonesia has lost a jungle area size of Germany, a threat to endangered animals, such as orangutans. The expansion of oil palm plantations to meet the international demand for palm oil remains one of the main causes of the destruction of the jungle Indonesia.Dos years after the big corporations consuming palm oil to make public its commitment to the fight against deforestation, Greenpeace has assessed the degree of compliance with these commitments by the world's 14 largest multinationals. The findings of this evaluaciónmuestran that only a few companies are taking significant steps to ensure that there is no deforestation in its palm oil supply chain and most are moving very slowly.  While they are not many differences, none of the companies can still ensure that the supply of palm oil is not linked to deforestation.  The worst assessment receive Colgate - Palmolive, Johnson &amp. Johnson and PepsiCo, which have shown a degree of compliance very poor, and cannot meet the promises made to their clients and consumers.  The palm oil is a widely used oil in a large amount of everyday consumer products, such as toothpaste Colgate, the cream of Neutrogena hands or nachos Doritos. "" The palm oil is part of a large amount of daily use products, and these big brands have the responsibility to ensure consumers are not working with deforestation.  The palm oil can grow responsibly without destroying the forests and without harming local communities or destroy the populations of orangutans and other animals "" [ 1 ], has declared the head of the Greenpeace Forests Campaign Spain, Miguel Angel Soto. Indonesia has lost 31 million hectares of tropical forest since 1990, a surface of the size of Germany.  The palm oil industry is the main cause of deforestation in Indonesia [ 2 ], which in turn is a major threat to the endangered animals that live there, such as orangutans. "" People should be able to clean teeth or take a few nachos without having to work with the extinction of orangutans.  In this regard, the companies PepsiCo, Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson are letting consumers.  They must do more to clean up its palm oil supply chain and ensure that only buy from suppliers who are protecting tropical forests "" has added Soto.La deforestation for the expansion of palm oil plantations was one of the cases resulted in the crisis of forest fires that ravaged Indonesia last year.  The estimate delcoste this economic disaster is 16 million dólaresy laextensa cloud humoafectó millions of people, not only in Indonesia, but also neighboring Malaysia and Singapore.  The Indonesian government data about more than 500,000 people quesufrieron respiratory diseases agudascomo result smoke.  The fires were also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions: in many days during October and November, the emisionesprocedentes forest fires exceeded the daily average of emissions from the United American economy. To prevent a new crisis fires occur this year 2016, Greenpeace has asked the companies consuming palm oil to take immediate steps to protect forests. The result of the Greenpeace rankings at 14 major companies reveals that none of the companies evaluated is capable of ensuring with certainty that there is no deforestation in its palm oil supply chain.  Most of the companies cannot even say what part of its palm oil from suppliers to meet their own standards supply.  In addition: ● Only one of the 14 companies are in a position to know the source (where grown) 100% of its palm oil. ● Most companies are still pending an independent verification showing its palm oil is produced by companies operating in compliance with their own policies not deforestation. ● No company has published a complete list of its palm oil suppliers, although some have made public the name of its main  Suppliers. ● No company has published a list of vendors who have stopped buying palm oil due to the failure of its policies not deforestation.

Unilever -Renounce palm oil and any other product related to tropical deforestation, and this on the entire supply chain.View the letter of petition ""Two billion consumers utilisentun Unilever product each day"" boasts the giant agri-food on its website. The raw material for its key brands Knorr, Dove or Fruit Or: palm oil. The tropical forests are destroyed and people expelled from their land to produce vegetable oil cheap tropical.Unilever said use palm oil ""sustainable"". However, the grim reality is that its supplier Wilmar buys palm oil from tropical deforestation.One of the cases of deforestation for palm oil was discovered in Indonesia by our partners deLink-ND Borneodans the sumptuous mangroves Kubu Raya district. The mangrove forests and bogs on the west coast of Borneo are among the largest and richest country.But the beauty of nature shall not businessmen eager to quick profits. The producer of palm oil PT Sintang Raya has thus established illegally plantations in the district. Known for his brutality, the company terrorizes the local population and destroyed mangrove forests for its plantations. And who buys palm oil PT Sintang Raya? Wilmar, largest distributor world, in which the supply companies such as Unilever.And this case is far from isolated: in the same district is the producer Rezeki Kencan whose palm oil also ends in the Unilever products through Wilmar.Even the Leuser Ecosystem Sumatra, last place of the planet where there are elephants, rhinos, tigers and orangutans is affected according to a new survey duRainforest Action Network. Again, Wilmar sells palm oil deforestation after various multinational, Unilever.The case PT Sintang Raya The company PT Sintang Raya operates a palm oil plantation of 20 000 hectares in the Kubu Raya district. In 2007, the company began illegally clearing the bogs and to take the land of peasants in seven villages. Since 2009, it has a licence to operate on 11 130 hectares, and so inexplicable because the study of environmental and social impact required (AMDAL) had not been carried out.PT Sintang Raya violated many laws and regulations including:-the continuation of the operation of its planting despite the apparent absence of the environmental impact-the ffense of the prohibition of conversion of peatlands in planting palm oil-the lack of facilities to combat forest fires, except for a single watch tower on the verge of collapse, despite the harshness of the dry season during the summer months-the elimination Inadequate wastewater plantations and waste In response, the local population filed a complaint against the company planting. And justice given reason by the court in 2011, a decision confirmed by the Court of Appeal in 2012 and the Supreme Court in 2014.La planting Sintang Raya is therefore formally illegal.However, nothing has changed on the ground. Worse, Sintang Raya has counter-attacked and reached criminalize people who committed acts of resistance. Seventeen villagers were sentenced to imprisonment in 2014, others are still detained pending a trial. In this campaign of terror and intimidation, residents of seven villages fled to the complex of the Commission on Human Rights in 2016.The destruction of mangroves on the coastal belt of Kubu Raya had dramatic consequences on the security of the local water. The salt water is no longer blocked by mangroves and penetrates inside the land. The arable land is becoming more saline. Not only village populations have lost much of their traditional lands because of the producer of palm oil, but the remaining lands are barely usable. Drinking water has become a major problem.For leaders d&#039. Unilever Mr Polman, Madam, Sir, Your company claims to buy palm oil sustainable. However, we must note, again and again, that your suppliers destroy tropical forests, violate laws, taking land and terrorize the village populations.A plantations where the palm oil your provider Wilmar is managed by the company PT Sintang Raya in the Kubu Raya district in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan. The company is captured land belonging to seven villages, has intimidated and criminalised tens of their inhabitants. She cleared mangrove forests and establishes plantations palm oil on peat soils. The bogs and mangroves of Kubu Raya district are the largest and richest in biodiversity throughout Southeast Asia.The mangrove forests are essential for the protection of the climate, biodiversity and coastal areas. Their destruction is not only a violation of Indonesian law, it is also a crime against the planet and its people.The company PT Sintang Raya currently operates illegally and allows even despise the revocation of its operating licence by an Indonesian court.PT Sintang Raya is unfortunately not the only company whose palm oil reached Unilever through Wilmar. Another planting palm oil to the source of conflict is managed in the same district by PT Rezeki Kencana, member of the CPSR society.Other suppliers of Wilmar produce palm oil to the source of conflict as the company PT Bumi Niaga Agra that destroys the habitat of endangered species in the Leuser Ecosystem.I ask you to remove the palm oil of your products and to end your business relationships with companies that pillage the environment.Please believe, Mr. Polman, Madam, Sir, the assurance of my account and my vigilant citizen.With 66 million tonnes per year, palm oil is the most produced vegetable oil in the world. A particularly low prices on the world market and properties particularly suited to the industrial processing of food that palm oil is present today in a product on two supermarkets: frozen pizzas, biscuits, margarine, cream for the body, soap, makeup, candles, laundry ... that almost nobody knows: almost half of imports of palm oil in the European Union is consumed in the form of biofuels. The law of 2009 on the mandatory incorporation of biofuels in gasoline and diesel is thus a major cause of tropical deforestation.To date, the oil palm plantations extend on 27 million hectares across the world, a territory large as New Zealand where were driven people and animals to make room for a ""green desert"".The palm oil are optimal conditions for growth in the hot and humid tropical regions near Ecuador. In Southeast Asia, South America and Africa, huge zonesde tropical forests are cleared and burned, day after day, to make room for plantations. In doing so, large amounts of greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere. Indonesia, first producer of palm oil in the world, has issued more gas greenhouse that the United States of America during the year 2015. Emissions of CO2 and methane make biofuels based on palm oil three times more harmful to the climate that fuels based on oil.But the climate is not the only affected: with trees disappear from rare species such as the orangutan, the pygmy elephant of Borneo or Sumatra tiger. Peasants and indigenous peoples, which for generations live in the forest and preserve, are often brutally expelled from their land. To date, 700 conflicts related to land industry palm oil were identified in Indonesia. And the plantations managed ""sustainable manner"" or ""bio"" are not exempt from violations of human rights of the population.We, consumers, hear little talk. Yet, our daily intake of palm oil is harmful to our own health: palm oil refined is rich in industrial contaminant genotoxic and carcinogenic as has alerted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) during the summer of 2016.It is only 70 000 orangutans in the forests of Southeast Asia. European policy of support for biofuels grows great apes always on the brink of extinction: each new palm oil plantation destroyed part of its natural habitat. We must put pressure on policies to help our closest relatives. But there are daily practices can already make a lot.These simple tips will help you know where palm oil is and how avoid: Help us reach 150 000 signatures: We act for the preservation of tropical forests.

BUT NOT WE news Our values Our Carve our information on social networks Forests September 27, 2016 In recent years, millions of hectares of forest and peatlands have been destroyed for the culture of oil palm, the  Expense of biodiversity, climate and local populations. According to a study published this month, more than 100 000 people died prematurely in 2015 alone in Southeast Asia because of toxic fumes related to deforestation. &#013. The forest fires, a scourge gigantic. Forest Fires in Kalimantan. D &rsquo. after our research, almost half of forest fires and bogs found in 2015 in the regions of Riau and West Kalimantan (Borneo) were located in concessions palm oil or trees to pulp.  North of Kalimantan, 48% of these fires were located in concessions palm oil. Children, without any respiratory protection, play in a court d &rsquo. school in Kalimantan, while the toxic fumes of forest fires are not yet resolved. The Indonesian government believes that 1, 7 million hectares &#8211. a surface barely smaller than the Wales, went to smoke 2015, for a rejection of CO2 in the atmosphere above all emissions United Kingdom for one year ().  In 25 years, Indonesia has lost a quarter of its tropical forest, one of the most important and most valuable in the world. It is clear today that producers of palm oil must respond to these fires: no matter who lit the flame, the clearing and drainage of peatlands. to plant palm oil and other industrial species, which establish the conditions conducive to fires. Forest Fires between two concessions d &rsquo. IOI To address this scourge environmental and health, the Indonesian government is committed to force companies to restore the plots destroyed by the fires.  And many hundreds of thousands of us have been pressing for major brands such as Colgate strengthen their policies Zero Deforestation. While significant progress is observed in the sector palm oil, some dealers are lagging behind.  This is particularly the case of IOC-UNESCO, a giant palm oil based in Malaysia, which is striving for almost a decade to make promises for the break immediately.  She is one of the biggest importers of palm oil in Europe and provided, in the past, brands such as Nestlé and Unilever.  If it is difficult to always draw precisely the palm oil, that produced by IOI is undeniably present in toothpastes and biscuits that we consume. For the moment, IOI is fate remaining discrete.  Al &rsquo. reverse companies turn directly to the consumer and must therefore &rsquo. s adapt to the requirements of the general public, IOI has no mark to defend public and operates in the shadow: 87 followers on Twitter.  Yet IOI is probably one of the worst companies you have never heard. IOI and deforestation, it is a long history.  Greenpeace has revealed his involvement in the deforestation of the region of Kalimantan in 2008.  Since then, IOC-UNESCO has converted tens of thousands of hectares in plantations palm oil &#8211. including habitat areas of a species of orangutan today threatened.  Moreover, it continues to buy palm oil companies deforesting. Survey Greenpeace on the ground.  Here recently deforested land. It also ignores the risk of fire associated with drainage bogs, which once dried are rendered extremely flammable.  The fires are a boon to farmers: they cleared forested areas and make fertile for their industrial plantations.  The Indonesian government tries to solve this problem by requiring companies to restore the plots burned.  She seems not yet received the logs: in 2016, members of Greenpeace visited a plantation company and found evidence that palm oil had been planted () in areas recently burned. She has always known violent social conflict.  The Long Teran Kanan (EN), a Malaysian community whose land has been taken by IOI in 1996 and converted to plantations palm oil, has tried to recognize its rights for six years. The company has also been accused of abuse on its employees (. &#8211. as the confiscation of their passports and the exercise of pressure to prevent them from syndicate.  Many of them have also testified that IOC-UNESCO paid well below the legal minimum wage. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (CPSR), a ""roundtable"" bringing together companies palm oil plantations but also consuming businesses and NGOs, is supposed to verify that those who claim this label set up sustainability policies concrete and effective.  But it is very serious. While she knows the IOI practices for years, the CPSR waited April this year for the exclude ... before the return in August, even before IOC-UNESCO makes anything to repair the damage which it is responsible. Today, it is quite possible, by applying the methodology HCS recognized and implementation by a growing number of industry players, to produce palm oil Zero Deforestation.  That is why we are today a action to ask IOI totally change its practices: several of our activists, with l &rsquo. using our ship Esperanza, blocked this morning goods IOI in the port of Rotterdam, Holland.

Oréal, Mars, Mondeléz, Nestle, PepsiCo, Procter &amp. Gamble, PZ Cussons, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever.Wilmar deceived all these producers of palm oil supplied through a front company, Gama Plantation, also dedicated to the production of palm oil and directed by senior executives of Wilmar and members of his family. As Wilmar had committed to policies of zero deforestation, had delegated the dirty work to Gama Plantation. This company Gama, has cut more than 25,000 hectares in the province of West Papua (Indonesia) since 2013, when Wilmar promised to end its ties with deforestation.As a result of the scandal, on July 4, it was learned that the co-founder of Wilmar had resigned from his post, just a week after Greenpeace revealed his links with Gama Plantation. His brother, Hendri Saksti, head of Wilmar in Indonesia and manager of Gama Plantation, a company related to palm oil responsible for massive deforestation in Indonesia has also resigned.Wilmar belongs to the Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a palm oil certification system so far has made little progress in order to avoid deforestation. Greenpeace has requested this body a strong response against the company.Also on this scandal, just two days later than the Greenpeace complaint, on June 27, the RSPO suspended the membership of the company Nestle. Nestle had not reported their progress in buying palm oil ""sustainable"" (allegedly sustainable would say). In recent years, Greenpeace has reported at least 5 cases of members of the RSPO that have destroyed the rainforest, including companies that are part of the governing board of the RSPO and his panel of conflict resolution. And the RSPO has not taken any action against them. Now Nestle suspended for failing to buy enough RSPO palm oil. This shows that the RSPO is more concerned with raising money to protect forests.Neither the RSPO or major producers such as Wilmar are giving clear and determined steps to make credible their promises. It is necessary for companies that destroy forests to stay out of the supply chain.Against this background, we are asking brands and palm oil traders to suspend their business with Wilmarhasta that this company seriously addresses the violations of its policy of not deforestation, starting to make public their forest concessions maps all groups of producers within its supply chain. / / 17 posts"

Now, once again, the Wilmar Group, palm oil supplier for Unilevers. Please protest with us! "" "" whole you came to the lunch hour and were equipped for an anti-terror use: on the Indonesian island of Sumatra 700 armed soldiers stormed the notorious special unit Brimob and the security forces of the Wilmar Group, the small village of Sungai Beruang.Innerhalb few minutes destroyed and they looted everything that the people had painstakingly built.  In panic fled a hundred men, women and children from the guns and bulldozers of the mobile brigades in the woods. 40 of them are still gone.  There are indigenous people of the people of the Suku Anak Dalam since many generations here at home, and more and more to survive have to fight against their own government, against palm oil corporations and their chains. The trigger of this violent action is an eternal recurrence in the painful history of the palm oil production in Indonesia, people are driven off their land, the rain forest from where they live, giant palm oil plantations.  Anyone who is intimidated, imprisoned or shot at.  The worst palm oil companies, including the world's largest, Wilmar International.  Operators of more than 600,000 hectares of plantations on Sumatra and Borneo.  Notorious for illegal logging and human rights violations. For more information, ""Wilmar hires armed Brimob-Brigaden to the people who are against theft and violence, to muzzle,"" says Feri Irawan.  ""Wilmar operates a bloody business."" Together with other activists, Feris organization has documented the violence and organised a demonstration in front of the parliament building of the provincial capital Jambi. Unilever is 1.3 million tonnes per year, one of the world's largest palm oil consumers.  From Rama to Dove to signal/palm oil in almost every product.  And Wilmar International is one of its main suppliers. How many more people in Indonesia need to fear for their lives, so that the corporation Unilever his responsibility?  Save the rainforest calls on the corporate level, palm oil through domestic fats. Please sign our letter to the Unilever chief for Germany, Austria and the Schweiz.Wir are passed him personally. On Monday, 8 ..  August, it hit the farmers Zainal first and then his whole village.  Zainal had harvested palm oil fruits on land that already belonged to his ancestors.  On the way to the factory was Zainals trucks and cargo of the company PT Asiatic Persada seized the security people.  It is a subsidiary of the world's largest palm oil firm Wilmar International.  Jambi in the province on Sumatra, where Zainals village is, it also has 30,000 hectares of plantations.  ""The indigenous and farmers has been stolen for these plantations of the forest,"" says Feri Irawan, head of our partner organization, Perkumpulan Hijau.  "" Now they try to survive amid huge palm oil plantations.  Because they want to sell at any price. "" If the people in their plight of palm fruits, then the company responds with violence. Asiatic Persada claims the palm oil for themselves.  Did last year 18 farmers from the nearby village of Bungku.  Together with Global film we have the case of the sustainability lie in our film. As Zainal his truck back, escalated the situation.  Wilmars security men called the Brimob soldiers, 18 men were arrested and, finally, the Brigades raided the village and Kesselten it for days.  The Brimob shot with live ammunition and met a man in the back.  He has since disappeared.  Zainal and four of his family members are still in the police prison in the district capital Batanghari. In the documentary film ""The sustainability lie"" Global Alliance film and the rainforest we have clearances and the conflicts of the Wilmar Group with the man with the camera.  On YouTube, you can also look at the video Rama-Brotvon Robin Wood. HerrnHenricus BrouwerGeschäftsführer Unilever Holding GmbH.Strandkai 120457 Hamburg Germany Subject: its relationship with Wilmar International Mr Brouwer, we are dismayed by the recent violence in the province of Jambi in Sumatra, which was reported. Again you probably has a Wilmar daughter (PT Asiatic Persada) the paramilitary brigades Brimob hired to intimidate indigenous peoples and peasants with guns and distribute.  Have at least one man shooting in the back seriously injured. the houses of 40 families were completely destroyed, and Geplündert.Wieder was the background of the conflict between the palm oil industry and the natives who live for generations from the rainforest.  And the last two decades systematically destroying for massive industrial monocultures.  On the route, the people, the tropical nature with its invaluable species and our climate.  Because Indonesia is through rainforest destruction of the third largest CO2 polluter in the world.  But you sure know that. And you probably know, too, that Wilmar International, one of its major palm oil supplier, is responsible for illegal logging and severe human rights violations. The employee of Alliance have the rainforest in Central and West Kalimantan and Sumatra seen with your own eyes.  And that is for many years by local and international environmental and human rights organizations documented and of world public opinion.  Maybe you know the 12-minütige video "" The sustainability lie-as the palm oil industry is the world.  It was in the autumn of 2010 by Global Film and Alliance of the rainforest in Kalimantan and Sumatra.  They should have missed the short documentation-it is on our website http://www.regenwald.org/news/3188/die-Nachhaltigkeits-luge-a-film-about-the-dirty-Geschaft-im-rain forest sustainability.  You already have 2008 of your customers informed that you would buy sustainable palm oil from 2009 and from 2015 ""sustainably grown"" palm oil use is Würden.Es, for example, in Central Kalimantan a palm oil plantation near Sampit, which is 100 kilometres long and 8 kilometres wide.  The lion's share is one Wilmar.  Can such a monoculture by fertilizers and pesticides bring big returns to be sustainable? There is no sustainability to industrial plantations-despite all the seal of the world nothing. And also, how credible is a company, which can be a plantation (e.g.  Mustika Sembuluh in Central Kalimantan, one Wilmar-Tochter) and next door to another without permission to chop down the forest and the farmers? Can you do business with such a company?  And its customers to think everything is fine? We believe that no.  And urge you to ask the palm oil in your products consistent with domestic fats.

These plans come after asinvestigações the organizaçãoMighty Earthe newspaper britânicoThe Guardian, which revealed the extension dadestruição of forests and protected areas of the two countries, driven by the chocolate industry. &#8220 . A large amount docacau used in chocolate produced by Mars, Nestle, Hershey&# 8217 . s, Godiva and other major chocolate companies was cultivated ilegalmente&#8221 ., concluded the researchers, which also warned that, if no preventive measures are taken, Until 2030, the Ivory Coast will lose all their forests. The investigations brought to light the fact that some authorities costa-marfinenses corrupt are accepting huge bribes to allow small farmers to cut and burn protected forests in order to grow cocoa in them. This is also lead to the emergence of towns and villages with thousands of inhabitants within national parks.The illegally produced cocoa is later purchased by brokers and sold to large cocoa merchants, such as Barry Callebaut, Olam and Cargill, registered providers such as Cadbury, aMars and Nestle.According to aMighty Earth, the measures planned by governments are promising, but will not be successful if cocoa merchants and chocolate manufacturers not to invest in this effort. &#8220 . The great danger now is that the industry will postpone making a decision and blame the governments of Ghana and Ivory Coast, making them resolve the problem without giving a sufficient financial contribution. But who has the money and technical resources to resolve this is the indústria&#8221 ., said Etelle Higonnet, author of relatório&#8220 . The Dark Secret of Chocolate&# 8221 . daMighty Earth.The jornalThe Guardiancontactou brands Mars, Hershey Company and Mondelez to know their positions, but these not confirmed if they invest money in the plans of governments.According to the project plan Ivory Coast, these merchants take, each, responsibility for some protected forests degraded, organizing farmers to replant trees at the same time that these grow cocoa in your shadow. This is a more sustainable way of cultivating cocoa than the current, where producers cut old trees to ensure that your cacueiros have a lot of light.Some forests costa-marfinenses win national park status and one of these parks, the Marahoué, you can lose your status for being in such bad conditions.Ghana's plans include a commitment to end the new deforestation operations and transparency in the supply chain, among other measures.It is clear who will finance the plans of the two countries. The Ivory Coast expects other merchants to pay, but would not specify what the consequences if they refused. Moreover still the problem of communities that have settled in protected areas &#8211 . the government has been accused of human rights violations by thousands of cocoa producers have evicted the national park Mont Péko.Cocoa prices in both countries fell a third in the past year and Ghana's economy has been affected by lower gold prices and petróleo.Os monitoring efforts and reforestation will be very costly and the country will have difficulty in finance.For Etelle Higonnet, is clear : companies and chocolate marketers must pay. &#8220 . companies need to pay for the planting of trees in the next year. They will have, probably, profits of four thousand million, porqueo price of chocolate bars remained the same but the price of cocoa is the colapsar&#8221 ., said. &#8220 . Therefore, what they can do with this extra money ? Well, you can use it to plant trees. &#8221 . There is still concern that, with the largest restrictiveness in West Africa, companies transfer trade to other regions, such as Amazon, Central Africa and Southeast Asia. &#8220 . continue to reproduce the same disasters that we saw in West Africa unless we protect these forests agora&#8221 ., told investigadora.1ª Photo : WWF Subscribe to Newsletter Ial Ial Environment, Chocolate, Ivory Coast, deforestation, Ghana, Nestle, 1ª Photo : WWF Environment, Chocolate, Ivory Coast, deforestation, Ghana, Nestle

But: it's just not true! Our Indonesian colleagues today at a press conference in Jakarta published evidence that APP is systematically violating the Indonesian law and the CITES and processing illegally harvested timber from the Indonesian forest.(If the captions do not appear automatically, click the CC icon)Rams of rare trees (Gonystylus spp.) Grow in Indonesian wetlands, which are also home to the critically endangered Sumatran tiger. Our latest mapping has shown that since 2001, at least 180,000 hectares of wetland forest have been mined in the territory for which the APP has been concessions, twice the size of New York City. No wonder that there are only 400 Sumatran tigers in the wild!During the past year, our colleagues from the Indonesian branch of Greenpeace have visited several times the largest APP cellulose plant. In the stacks of other tropical trees that were waiting for grinding and processing, they also found a host of illegally harvested stems of the ramin tree. To prove that this is a rare species of tree, they took the samples and sent them to the end-to-end specialist laboratory in Germany. The lab confirmed that all the samples were really of the ramin tree.Detailed search results can be found here (currently in AJ)In addition to finding out that APP has illegally harvested timber from the ramin tree, our colleagues also traced where cellulose and APP paper travels: they found a way leading to big world brands such as Xerox, National Geographic or Danone. Likewise, in the case of the Barbie doll, we sent their products to forensic analysis, which showed that they contain wood fibers from the rainforest.But it's not just an APP that violates Indonesian laws, because some of the biggest customers of this woodworking concern are involved in the Indonesian rainforest wood scandal. Companies like Xerox or Danone must now follow large companies such as Mattel, Nestlé or Adidas, which have already broke their contracts with APP.Our Indonesian colleagues now submit a video with police evidence. Today, they also met representatives of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture and CITES responsible authorities and urged them to immediately confiscate all illegally harvested ramin trees at the APP factories and jointly shut down the timber trade of this precious Indonesian rainforest tree.Greenpeace has been studying APP for indifferent approaches to Indonesian forests for a long time. Two years ago, we pointed out that the APP subsidiary, Sinar Mas, is cutting down the Indonesian rainforest due to oil palm plantations. Thanks to the intensive Greenpeace campaign and consumer support, Nestlé has managed to stop the biggest food company from stopping Sinar Mas's palm oil from taking off.APP: Scandal with illegal forest woodon this pageNew - March 1, 2012(If the captions do not appear automatically, click the CC icon)"

It&#39.s still fun because the end of the week is near. But for us and the thousands of people who have sent e-mails to General Mills, Friday&#39.s is a Friday&#39.s victory. A significant step for the future of Indonesia&#39.s forests. That day, General Mills producing Betty Crockers agreed to stop purchasing palm oil supplies from IOI, a Malaysian company that has been linked to forest destruction in Kalimantan. IOI, one of Malaysia&#39.s largest palm oil companies, is facing tough times. Not only has it lost the ongoing RSPO (Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil) certification-the organization for sustainable palm oil and the suspension of its membership status, but also one by one its customers began to leave business with IOI. The latest report released by Greenpeace shows a list of promises not met by IOI, especially the commitment in January 2014 not to drain peatland in its concession. But strong evidence suggests the canals were dug to dry up peatland in PT Bumi Sawit Sejahtera (PT BSS) area, one of IOI concessions in West Kalimantan. Dry peatlands are very susceptible to flammable and flammable fire, certainly not surprising that the fires that occurred in 2014 and 2015 lasted mostly on PT.BSS land. The impact of drying is far beyond the boundaries of PT BSS concessions. The surrounding area that dries up becomes vulnerable to fire and it is certain that peatland damage in the area also occurs. However IOI does not recognize the damage caused. IOI also ignored the GOI&#39.s efforts to prevent last year&#39.s fires from recurring, including ministerial instructions to block the canals and not to plant oil palm on burning land. Field investigations in April uncovered major canals remained unopposed in the PT BSS concession and oil palm seeds were planted on burning peatlands. IOI is clearly worried about losing its RSPO certification and losing its customers. They even sued the RSPO&#39.s decision to legalize, even though IOI is the founder and sits as its board. The good news, earlier this week, the IOI itself decided to stop their demands, perhaps hoping to use the opportunity of the RSPO meeting that took place in Milan today (Thursday, June 9) as a lobby to convince the RSPO in order to regain its membership status. A new action plan prepared by IOI as a prerequisite for completion of the RSPO complaint has been prepared. Unfortunately, it is not much different from existing policies and plans. There are many shortcomings at various levels including the absence of forest and peatland mapping plans, no measurable objectives or deadlines, no plans to end peat drainage and no plans to release concession maps. Many IOI customers are urging IOI to exceed the relatively weak RSPO standards if the company wants to get back in business with them. Looking at his track record, it seems that many IOI customers are still unsure of the new commitments and policies, as there is still much to do in the field to create real change - starting with stemming canals, restoring damaged peatlands and releasing forest maps and Peatlands in their concession areas. Until all that happens, the RSPO should continue to suspend IOI membership, as well as customers who have terminated the contract, should keep delaying purchases from IOI until the company is completely changed and monitor every commitment and real action to protect Indonesia&#39.s forests.

The moratorium applies to &ograve. only to land controlled by the Indonesian Ministry of Forests and not interested in those controlled by the regional government or the forest areas forming part of concessions already &agrave. existing, leaving then without protection million hectares of forest and peat bogs.The announcement of the Indonesian government &egrave. arrived the day after the launch of the report diGreenpeace ""Final countdown"", which denounces the destruction of 130,000 hectares of rainforest since 2015, 40% of them in Papua, one of the regions most &ugrave. rich in biodiversit &agrave. of the planet. The report also reveals how important twenty-five of palm oil producers are responsible not only to deforestation, illegal extension of their plantations and fires, but also of exploitation of workers. Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Hershey's, Kellogg's, Kraft Heinz, The CW, Mars, Mondelez, Nestl &eacute., PepsiCo, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever have purchased palm oil by at least twenty of these producers.In 2013, Greenpeace International had revealed cheWilmar-giant of sour business and main operator of palm oil in the world-and its suppliers eranoresponsabilidella deforestation, fires in peat bogs and the massive destruction of the habitat of the Sumatran tiger. At the end of that year, the multinational announced unaambiziosa politicadi ""no-deforestazione, no-destruction of peatlands and no-exploitation of workers"". But, as we read in the new report, Wilmar continues to buy palm oil from at least 18 suppliers who destroy the forests and expropriated land to the community &agrave. local.To protest against this inconsistency, September 25, 2018 thirty of Greenpeace activists have blocked a tanker carrying palm oil and they occupied a refinery property &agrave.

The refinery, located on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the palm oil works of three of the producers mentioned in the report ""Final Countdown"" because &eacute. guilty of the destruction of rain forests are on the Indonesian islands of Kalimantan and Papua.

Through a subsidiary Unilever does business with Sawit Sumbermas Sarana (SSMS), a palm oil company at Kalimantan, whose owner has in the past been associated with kidnapping and the illegal hood of tropical forest, including in Tanjung Puting National Park.SSMS (185 million euro revenue in 2016) has more than 70,000 hectares of palm oil plantations. At least one-fifth was previously tropical rainforest, calculated the American NGO Chain Reaction Research in 2015. That same year, the palm farmer announced that he wanted to cut over 10,000 hectares of forest again.The Report of Chain Reaction Research, about SSMS:Environmental organizations responded to a round table for palm oil producers and NGOs (an initiative by Unilever, even the world's largest palm oil buyer). The palm farmer would have provided incorrect information about the presence of pieces of land with a so-called high conservation value. A protected status.Pakanbaru, Indonesia: unknowns have burned a piece of jungle, presumably to make room for a palm oil plantation. Photo BloombergAfter that, the company continued to cut wood. The plantation does not recognize the sustainability code driven by Unilever within the palm oil industry. This requires, among other things, producers who are not harvesting or harvesting farmland for the construction of plantations, and respecting the rights of employees and locals. The three largest customers of SSMS - including Unilever supplier Wilmar International - stopped selling palm oil at the producer two years ago.At the same time, SSMS received a new customer from their financial reports: Unilever Oleochemical Indonesia (UOI). This subsidiary opened its own refinery in North Sumatra in 2015. By processing palm oil itself, the multinational wants to be less dependent on big players like Wilmar. ""An important step in the preservation of our chain"", topman Paul Polman called it at the opening ceremony. One of the palm farmers where UOI has purchased directly since then is SSMS. How much is not clear. But the last quarterly report from SSMS shows that it had to receive 3.9 million euros from the Unilever daughter in March.Asked for their trade with SSMS, a spokeswoman by mail informs Unilever that ""is very concerned about the allegations of environmental organizations against SSMS. The multinational has set a deadline for SSMS to ""solve some issues"". She does not wonder why Unilever continues trading until that time.Since its inception, Polman has been doing its best to make the food ingredient more sustainable in 2008. He promised to halve the environmental impact of Unilever and at the same time double the turnover. But recent research of the journalism platform Investico shows that the multinational is regularly growing greener than it actually is. For example, the website of their Indonesian daughter says that since 2012 all palm oil used by Unilever is ""sustainable sources"". In practice, in 2015, no fifth of Unilever's palm oil came from certified plantations.Wilmar International also finds its sharpened sustainability requirements are still not always alive. For example, Amnesty International wrote about exploitation and child labor on plantations of the world's largest palm oil company in the autumn. In addition, Wilmar (like Nestlé) bought palm oil from a producer that scored even worse than SSMS last year: this palm farmer in Sumatra continued in 2016 with mining and replanting peat despite a moratorium of the Indonesian president.Do you have a tip about this topic, do you see a spelling mistake or actual mistake?We appreciate it if you send us a message.NRC Media Holding BV uses cookies and similar techniques.

Deforestation and drainage of peatlands are widely recognized as the root cause of the fire crisis, including by the Indonesian government.

Meanwhile, the government has identified 15 million ha of forest available for land clearing and development that will mostly be used for biofuels and agriculture, with oil palm as its priority.Greenpeace Forest Campaigner Annisa Rahmawati said,""In my life, more than a quarter of Indonesia's forests have been plundered, the people of Indonesia are responsible for the damage and forest fires that affect the health and livelihoods of millions of people, all to supply global demand for cheap palm oil, paper and wood.Two of the oil palm plantations investigated by Greenpeace are linked to the IOI Group, a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The third is owned by Alas Kusuma Group, where several companies of this group hold the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certificate.Greenpeace calls on all companies to open their concession data more transparently and publicly available and announce measures to be taken to protect forests and peatlands and ensure they do not contribute to the ensuing fire crisis. The RSPO should also call on its members to publish concession maps, in accordance with the results of a resolution approved at the RSPO conference two years ago.These cases expose systemic failures by the Indonesian plantation sector to end deforestation. The measures taken by the company are not yet strong enough to stop their suppliers from destroying forests and peatlands. Greenpeace therefore calls on commodity traders and palm oil buyers and pulp companies from Indonesia to cooperate in broadly banning industry against deforestation and peatland clearing, including disconnecting third-party suppliers that still violate them.Annisa continued,Some time ago, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has promised to ban the opening of new peatlands, including those already licensed.

According to a study published this month, more than 100 000 people died prematurely in 2015 alone in Southeast Asia because of toxic fumes related to deforestation. &#013. The forest fires, a scourge gigantic. Forest Fires in Kalimantan. D &rsquo. after our research, almost half of forest fires and bogs found in 2015 in the regions of Riau and West Kalimantan (Borneo) were located in concessions palm oil or trees to pulp.  North of Kalimantan, 48% of these fires were located in concessions palm oil. Children, without any respiratory protection, play in a court d &rsquo. school in Kalimantan, while the toxic fumes of forest fires are not yet resolved. The Indonesian government believes that 1, 7 million hectares &#8211. a surface barely smaller than the Wales, went to smoke 2015, for a rejection of CO2 in the atmosphere above all emissions United Kingdom for one year ().  In 25 years, Indonesia has lost a quarter of its tropical forest, one of the most important and most valuable in the world. It is clear today that producers of palm oil must respond to these fires: no matter who lit the flame, the clearing and drainage of peatlands. to plant palm oil and other industrial species, which establish the conditions conducive to fires. Forest Fires between two concessions d &rsquo. IOI To address this scourge environmental and health, the Indonesian government is committed to force companies to restore the plots destroyed by the fires.  And many hundreds of thousands of us have been pressing for major brands such as Colgate strengthen their policies Zero Deforestation. While significant progress is observed in the sector palm oil, some dealers are lagging behind.  This is particularly the case of IOC-UNESCO, a giant palm oil based in Malaysia, which is striving for almost a decade to make promises for the break immediately.  She is one of the biggest importers of palm oil in Europe and provided, in the past, brands such as Nestlé and Unilever.  If it is difficult to always draw precisely the palm oil, that produced by IOI is undeniably present in toothpastes and biscuits that we consume. For the moment, IOI is fate remaining discrete.  Al &rsquo. reverse companies turn directly to the consumer and must therefore &rsquo. s adapt to the requirements of the general public, IOI has no mark to defend public and operates in the shadow: 87 followers on Twitter.  Yet IOI is probably one of the worst companies you have never heard. IOI and deforestation, it is a long history.  Greenpeace has revealed his involvement in the deforestation of the region of Kalimantan in 2008.  Since then, IOC-UNESCO has converted tens of thousands of hectares in plantations palm oil &#8211. including habitat areas of a species of orangutan today threatened.  Moreover, it continues to buy palm oil companies deforesting. Survey Greenpeace on the ground.  Here recently deforested land. It also ignores the risk of fire associated with drainage bogs, which once dried are rendered extremely flammable.  The fires are a boon to farmers: they cleared forested areas and make fertile for their industrial plantations.  The Indonesian government tries to solve this problem by requiring companies to restore the plots burned.  She seems not yet received the logs: in 2016, members of Greenpeace visited a plantation company and found evidence that palm oil had been planted () in areas recently burned. She has always known violent social conflict.  The Long Teran Kanan (EN), a Malaysian community whose land has been taken by IOI in 1996 and converted to plantations palm oil, has tried to recognize its rights for six years. The company has also been accused of abuse on its employees (. &#8211. as the confiscation of their passports and the exercise of pressure to prevent them from syndicate.  Many of them have also testified that IOC-UNESCO paid well below the legal minimum wage. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (CPSR), a ""roundtable"" bringing together companies palm oil plantations but also consuming businesses and NGOs, is supposed to verify that those who claim this label set up sustainability policies concrete and effective.  But it is very serious. While she knows the IOI practices for years, the CPSR waited April this year for the exclude ... before the return in August, even before IOC-UNESCO makes anything to repair the damage which it is responsible. Today, it is quite possible, by applying the methodology HCS recognized and implementation by a growing number of industry players, to produce palm oil Zero Deforestation.

Request European supermarkets not to sell charcoal from deforestation in Paraguay.At Aldi, Carrefour and Lidl Thank you no longer sell product containing charcoal from tropical deforestation in Paraguay!View the letter of petition The region of Gran Chaco, South America, is the scene of a real tragedy: a rampant deforestation, fastest the planet. Species endemic, jaguars, anteaters, armadillos and 500 species of birds are threatened by the destruction of its forests tropical dry.But not only. The deforestation of the Gran Chaco also threatens the Ayoreo, one of the last isolated peoples of our modern industrial societies nomadic life is closely linked to the forest.This devastation is caused by the meat industry. The virgin forests of Chaco must leave room for pasture. Trees quebracho centenarians are slaughtered and carbonized in grinding primitives. More than 70% of this charcoal tropical timber is exported to Europe. Germany alone imports 20,000 bags per day. ""Without the knowledge, European consumers burn in their barbecue wood from ancient forests of South America"" said Toby Hill environmentalist organization britanniqueEarthsight.Nothing on the packaging suggests that coal is from tropical timber of Paraguay. Only the name of distribution companies in Europe are mentioned.Earthsight has published a report that highlights the devastating environmental impact of business charcoal in Paraguay. It follows the journey of charred trees until radius desupermarchés in Europe as Aldi, Lidl and Carrefour.In selling charcoal tropical, these supermarkets exacerbate deforestation in one of the last great wilderness areas of the world. The meat industry, soybeans and charcoal is responsible for the annual deforestation 250,000 hectares in Paraguay.Request Aldi, Carrefour and Lidl no longer buy charcoal from deforestation in Paraguay.The tropical dry forest of Gran Chaco is étendsur a vast territory to chevalsur Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Partly endemic, its fauna and flora are particularly rich: 3,400 species of plants, 500 species of birds, 150 species of mammals and 220 species of amphibians and reptiles. Its situation in the heart of Latin America in fact an important transit area for migratory birds. The Jaguars travel Chaco when they hunt tapirs, peccaries, large pigs water, giant armadillos and other aardvarks.The deforestation of Chaco also threatens the survival of native Ayoreo.Plusieurs nomadic groups of this indigenous people still live traditional way in the forest, without any contact with the outside world. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has already asked several times in the Government of Paraguay to take urgent measures for the protection of Ayoreo.Illustration 1: deforestation-marked in red-in Paraguay in 2006 and 2015 (source: globalforestwach.org) The virgin forest is shot around the Gran Chaco.

Who among barbecue enthusiasts in Europe could imagine that they use charcoal tropical from South America?At Aldi, Carrefour and Lidl Madam, Sir, The English ecologist organisation Earthsight has drawn charcoal from the destruction of forests dry Chaco to subsidiaries of Aldi, Carrefour and Lidl in Europe.The manufacture of this charcoal has catastrophic consequences on the nature and the people of this region. By destroying tropical forests of South American countries, manufacturers of charcoal are the dirty work for the meat industry that uses the deforested areas such as pasture for livestock.These practices threaten many plant and animal species, including some endemic, as well as indigenous peoples who depend on the forest for their livelihood.Most of the charcoal is exported to Europe. Each customer who buys and burns this charcoal is without wanting to the rampant destruction of forests of Paraguayan Chaco.We ask you to take without delay all necessary measures to charcoal from deforestation in Paraguay is no longer sold in your supermarkets.We urge you to believe, Madam, Sir, the assurance of our consideration and our vigilance citizen.Help us reach 150 000 signatures: We act for the preservation of tropical forests.

The company manages oil palm plantations and processes palm oil for the food industry as well as for the production of biofuels. Wilmar accounts for 45 percent of world trade with palm oil and is one of the largest growers of palm oil in Indonesia and Malaysian Borneo. According to Greenpeace and other environmental organizations, Wilmar is the company that has been responsible for the most extensive rainforest blast in Indonesia in recent years. In Uganda, Wilmars oil palm plantations have destroyed forests rich in biodiversity and expelled small farmers from their land, usually without compensation or other livelihoods.In 2016, Amnesty International found serious human rights violations on seven palm oil plantations operated by Wilmar in Indonesia, including children between 8 and 14 years performing heavy and dangerous work, systematic discrimination against women and parakat use A very toxic herbicide, without protective equipment. Wilmar sells the oil to nine global companies, such as Unilever, Nestlé and Procter & Gamble.After hard criticism, Wilmar adopted a policy against deforestation in 2013. But it remains to be seen whether it will be transformed into subcontractors and remedies for the damage caused by the company to people and the environment. The AP funds - which had large holdings in the company even before the policy was adopted - did not have an impact dialogue with the company.The AP funds also invest SEK 89.5 million in Malaysian Sime Darby, one of the world's largest palm oil companies. In 2009, they signed a 63-year lease agreement with the Liberian state, which would give them access to over 311,000 hectares of land, & # 8211. An area as large as Gotland. Cultivations have begun without consultation with affected villages, which company is obliged to do according to international regulations. Locals have been expelled and received insufficient or no compensation for their land, and important forest land has been destroyed. Large-scale investments in land have increased dramatically in Liberia and now cover around 25 percent of the country's surface.Soybean in South America is a threat to grasslands, savannah and forests, such as the artistic area of ​​Chaco in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia and the so-called Cerradon in Brazil. Cerradon holds about 5 percent of the world's biodiversity and represents an important source of water for all of South America. The expansion of soy crops has also led to forced migration of locals.The AP funds have invested SEK 415 million in the agricultural companies Archer Daniels Midland and 200 million Bunge, two giants dominating world trade with soy. Archer Daniels Midland and Bunge are committed to not buying soy that caused the Amazon's wreckage. However, companies do not have a corresponding policy for other areas with high biodiversity. Without commitment from these influential actors, no pressure is created on growers to prevent further conversion of valuable ecosystems into agricultural land. The AP funds have not had any dialogue to influence the companies.The Great Palm Oil Scandal & # 8211.

It tastes like always, looks like always, but what it contains, its manufacturer Unilever: palm oil, and that the blood of indigenous people and farmers in Indonesia, threatened, fired, arrested and expelled for its cultivation.  Now, once again, the Wilmar Group, palm oil supplier for Unilevers. Please protest with us! "" "" whole you came to the lunch hour and were equipped for an anti-terror use: on the Indonesian island of Sumatra 700 armed soldiers stormed the notorious special unit Brimob and the security forces of the Wilmar Group, the small village of Sungai Beruang.Innerhalb few minutes destroyed and they looted everything that the people had painstakingly built.  In panic fled a hundred men, women and children from the guns and bulldozers of the mobile brigades in the woods. 40 of them are still gone.  There are indigenous people of the people of the Suku Anak Dalam since many generations here at home, and more and more to survive have to fight against their own government, against palm oil corporations and their chains. The trigger of this violent action is an eternal recurrence in the painful history of the palm oil production in Indonesia, people are driven off their land, the rain forest from where they live, giant palm oil plantations.  Anyone who is intimidated, imprisoned or shot at.  The worst palm oil companies, including the world's largest, Wilmar International.  Operators of more than 600,000 hectares of plantations on Sumatra and Borneo.  Notorious for illegal logging and human rights violations. For more information, ""Wilmar hires armed Brimob-Brigaden to the people who are against theft and violence, to muzzle,"" says Feri Irawan.  ""Wilmar operates a bloody business."" Together with other activists, Feris organization has documented the violence and organised a demonstration in front of the parliament building of the provincial capital Jambi. Unilever is 1.3 million tonnes per year, one of the world's largest palm oil consumers.  From Rama to Dove to signal/palm oil in almost every product.  And Wilmar International is one of its main suppliers. How many more people in Indonesia need to fear for their lives, so that the corporation Unilever his responsibility?  Save the rainforest calls on the corporate level, palm oil through domestic fats. Please sign our letter to the Unilever chief for Germany, Austria and the Schweiz.Wir are passed him personally. On Monday, 8 ..  August, it hit the farmers Zainal first and then his whole village.  Zainal had harvested palm oil fruits on land that already belonged to his ancestors.  On the way to the factory was Zainals trucks and cargo of the company PT Asiatic Persada seized the security people.  It is a subsidiary of the world's largest palm oil firm Wilmar International.  Jambi in the province on Sumatra, where Zainals village is, it also has 30,000 hectares of plantations.  ""The indigenous and farmers has been stolen for these plantations of the forest,"" says Feri Irawan, head of our partner organization, Perkumpulan Hijau.  "" Now they try to survive amid huge palm oil plantations.  Because they want to sell at any price. "" If the people in their plight of palm fruits, then the company responds with violence. Asiatic Persada claims the palm oil for themselves.  Did last year 18 farmers from the nearby village of Bungku.  Together with Global film we have the case of the sustainability lie in our film. As Zainal his truck back, escalated the situation.  Wilmars security men called the Brimob soldiers, 18 men were arrested and, finally, the Brigades raided the village and Kesselten it for days.  The Brimob shot with live ammunition and met a man in the back.  He has since disappeared.  Zainal and four of his family members are still in the police prison in the district capital Batanghari. In the documentary film ""The sustainability lie"" Global Alliance film and the rainforest we have clearances and the conflicts of the Wilmar Group with the man with the camera.  On YouTube, you can also look at the video Rama-Brotvon Robin Wood. HerrnHenricus BrouwerGeschäftsführer Unilever Holding GmbH.Strandkai 120457 Hamburg Germany Subject: its relationship with Wilmar International Mr Brouwer, we are dismayed by the recent violence in the province of Jambi in Sumatra, which was reported. Again you probably has a Wilmar daughter (PT Asiatic Persada) the paramilitary brigades Brimob hired to intimidate indigenous peoples and peasants with guns and distribute.  Have at least one man shooting in the back seriously injured. the houses of 40 families were completely destroyed, and Geplündert.Wieder was the background of the conflict between the palm oil industry and the natives who live for generations from the rainforest.  And the last two decades systematically destroying for massive industrial monocultures.  On the route, the people, the tropical nature with its invaluable species and our climate.  Because Indonesia is through rainforest destruction of the third largest CO2 polluter in the world.  But you sure know that. And you probably know, too, that Wilmar International, one of its major palm oil supplier, is responsible for illegal logging and severe human rights violations. The employee of Alliance have the rainforest in Central and West Kalimantan and Sumatra seen with your own eyes.  And that is for many years by local and international environmental and human rights organizations documented and of world public opinion.  Maybe you know the 12-minütige video "" The sustainability lie-as the palm oil industry is the world.  It was in the autumn of 2010 by Global Film and Alliance of the rainforest in Kalimantan and Sumatra.  They should have missed the short documentation-it is on our website http://www.regenwald.org/news/3188/die-Nachhaltigkeits-luge-a-film-about-the-dirty-Geschaft-im-rain forest sustainability.  You already have 2008 of your customers informed that you would buy sustainable palm oil from 2009 and from 2015 ""sustainably grown"" palm oil use is Würden.Es, for example, in Central Kalimantan a palm oil plantation near Sampit, which is 100 kilometres long and 8 kilometres wide.  The lion's share is one Wilmar.  Can such a monoculture by fertilizers and pesticides bring big returns to be sustainable? There is no sustainability to industrial plantations-despite all the seal of the world nothing. And also, how credible is a company, which can be a plantation (e.g.  Mustika Sembuluh in Central Kalimantan, one Wilmar-Tochter) and next door to another without permission to chop down the forest and the farmers? Can you do business with such a company?  And its customers to think everything is fine? We believe that no.  And urge you to ask the palm oil in your products consistent with domestic fats.

Perusahaan minyak sawit terbesar di dunia. Kalian tau perusahaan itu kan? http://t.co/kH24q7PC6J #protectparadise;Wilmar Supplier, Caught Wet to Destroy Forest of BorneoBumitama Agri, a palm oil supplier company for Wilmar, a Singapore-based palm oil trader, was caught destroying Kalimantan's forests which are an important habitat for many critically endangered species, including Orangutans. Analysis of satellite maps and Greenpeace investigations in the field, found the fact that Bumitama has destroyed 1,150 hectares of forest land by 2013. Greenpeace asks Bumitama to immediately stop all forest clearing, and is committed to protecting all the peat and forests in the concession. Until Bumitama is committed to a zero deforestation policy, Orangutans and forests within their concessions will always be threatened.

Questo il movente che stamattina ha portato più di uncentinaio di attivisti di Greenpeacetravestiti daoranghiad invadere gli uffici e gli stabilimenti di Nestlé in Inghilterra, Germania e Olanda. Ma soprattutto apubblicare alle ore 12:00 di oggi un video shock di denuncia.Il video, adatto ad un pubblico adulto come specificano i titoli di testa, gioca sul noto claim ""spezza con Kit Kat"" e raffigura un inconsapevole impiegato che decide di fare un break proprio con lo snack incriminato. Ma l'epilogo non è esattamente quello a cui si è abituati, con tanto di sangue che inizia a scorrere sulla tastiera.""Beccato! Con le mani nel sangue""è, appunto, il titolo del ""crime file"" di Greenpeace in cui sono presenti leprove dei rapporti commerciali che Nestlé intrattiene con aziende come Sinar Mas, il più grande produttore diolio di palmain Indonesia che continua ad espandere, anche nell'illegalità, le proprie piantagioni a danno delleforeste torbiereche oltre ad essere enormi polmoni verdi in grado diridurre le emissioni, rappresentano anche l'habitat di molte specie animali e vegetali tra cui glioranghi in via di estinzione.Ogni anno Nestlé, si legge nel rapporto utilizza ogni anno più di320.000 tonnellate di olio di palmain una serie di prodotti tra cui, appunto, il Kit Kat: un consumo, per di più raddoppiato negli ultimi tre anni.«Ogni volta che dai un morso al tuo Kit Kat- avverte Chiara Campione, responsabile della campagna Foreste di Greenpeace Italia -potresti, senza saperlo, prendere a morsi un pezzo di foresta e contribuire all'estinzione degli ultimi oranghi. È ora che Nestlé conceda un break alla foreste in Indonesia, interrompendo i rapporti commerciali con il ""campione"" della deforestazione Sinar Mas».Dopo le prove fornite in questi anni da Greenpeace sul conto diSinar Mas, diverse multinazionali tra cui laKrafthanno interrotto i propri contatti commerciali con il distributore. E anche Nestlé, a due ora dal lancio sul sito web del video shock ""Have a break""ha risposto dichiarando l'intenzione di cancellare i propri contatti con Sinar Mas.Ma a Greenpeace non basta: «Se Nestlè non riuscirà a garantire che nessuno dei suoi fornitori acquista da Sinar Mas - sostiene la Campione - quanto dichiarato nel recente comunicato della multinazionale svizzera non ha alcun valore. Certo, però, dobbiamo ammettere che Nestlé risponde rapidamente se si lancia un video virale contro Kit Kat e un centinaio di attivisti di Greenpeace travestiti da oranghi invadono i loro principali uffici in Inghilterra, Germania e Olanda».Peché, se effettivamente risulta encomiabile il comunicato stampa di risposta della Nestlé, Greenpeace fa notare come la multinazionale svizzera intrattenga comunque accordi commerciali anche con lamultinazionale della carta APP, società sussidiaria proprio di Sinar Mas al centro dinumerosi altri blitz dell'associazione, per la produzione della carta utilizzata nel packaging dei suoi prodotti.«Diamo quindi un 10 e lode a Nestlè per il comunicato stampa più veloce della storia. Per l'impegno a fermare la deforestazione: bocciata!» conclude Campione.Simona Falasca";"Nestléutilizza in its products, Kit Katin primisolio of palmaproveniente from destruction delleforeste Indonesian. This motive this morning brought more than uncentinaio of activists Greenpeacetravestiti daoranghiad invade the offices and the establishment of Nestlé in England, Germany and the Netherlands. But above all apubblicare at 12.00 today a video shock of complaint.The video, suitable for an adult audience as specify the titles of head, play on the well-known claims ""breaks with Kit Kat"" and depicts an unwitting employee who decides to make a break with the snacks really charged. But the epilogue is not exactly what you are accustomed to, with a lot of blood begins to flow on the keyboard."" Gotcha ! With your hands in blood ""is, indeed, the title of the"" crime file "" of Greenpeace in which there are leprove of trade relations that Nestlé has with companies like Sinar Mas, the largest producer diolio of palmain Indonesia which continues to expand, even in the lawlessness, their plantations to damage delleforeste torbiereche as well as being a huge green lungs able diridurre emissions, are also the habitat of many species of animals and plants including glioranghi developing Extinction.Every year Nestlé, one reads in the report uses every year more di320.000 tons of oil palmain a series of products including, in fact, the Kit Kat : a consumption, for more than doubled in the last three years."" Every time you give a bite to your Kit Kat, warns Chiara Campione, campaign manager of Greenpeace Italy Doubt Forests, without knowing, take off a piece of forest and contribute to the extinction of the last orangutans. It's time for Nestlé gives a break to the forests in Indonesia, interrupting the trade with the ""champion"" of deforestation Sinar Mas "".After the evidence provided in recent years by Greenpeace on behalf diSinar Mas, several multinational companies including laKrafthanno interrupted their commercial contacts with the distributor. And even Nestlé, two hours from the launch on the website of the video shock ""Have a break"" he said declaring the intention to cancel their contacts with Sinar Mas.But Greenpeace is not enough : "" If Nestle fails to ensure that none of its suppliers purchase from Sinar Mas-supports the Champion-how declared in the recent statement of the Swiss multinational has no value. Of course, however, we must admit that Nestlé responds quickly if you throw a viral video against Kit Kat and a hundred of Greenpeace activists dressed as orangutans invade their main offices in England, Germany and the Netherlands "".Why, if indeed it is commendable the press release response of Nestlé, Greenpeace points out how the Swiss multinational congress still trade agreements even with lamultinazionale APP paper, company subsidiary right Sinar Mas at the center dinumerosi other raid of the association, for the production of the paper used in the packaging of its products."" We then a 10 and praise to Nestle for the press release faster than the story. For the commitment to stop the deforestation : fail ! "" Champion concludes.Simona Falasca"
