# Watson_for_MANA

Watson AI modules help MANA process thousands of articles to track environmental impact. The specific architecture of this solution make the best use of different Watson modules to achieve an optimized result.

Feel free to reuse and adapt this script to tap into IBM Watson AI processing power with any relevant information in your own field. Only tacit requirement is that it is a purposeful challenge, helping with other environmental or social challenges.

# Challenge definition

MANA’s aim: Be the First citizen platform to collect and valorize data assessing the impact of businesses/corporations on the environment on a global scale. 
How to achieve this goal ?
By treating/processing information (articles, tweets) coming from its unique Network made of:
1500 sources
in 80 languages
=> Enormous amounts of articles to read through
Problem: It is (linearly) costly in time for human beings to read those
Solution: Watson Artificial Intelligence processing power can dramatically reduce the workload
